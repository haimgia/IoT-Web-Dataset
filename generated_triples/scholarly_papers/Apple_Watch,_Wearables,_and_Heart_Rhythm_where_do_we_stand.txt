Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) poses a major health concern in
Triples: [
]


Text: the United States by affecting over 5 million people (1). It
Triples: [
]


Text: is associated with significant mortality and morbidity by
Triples: [
]


Text: increasing the risk of stroke 5-fold compared to general
Triples: [
]


Text: population (2). In the United States, AF accounts for at
Triples: [
]


Text: least 15% to 25% of strokes (3). It can be asymptomatic
Triples: [
]


Text: or subclinical with its first presentation being stroke
Triples: [
]


Text: in 18%, and AF being newly detected at the time of
Triples: [
]


Text: stroke (4). Furthermore, the prevalence of AF increases
Triples: [
]


Text: with age, being 65 or older places the prevalence around
Triples: [
]


Text: 4.4% with people who have previously undiagnosed AF
Triples: [
]

Triples: [
]

With evidence of subclinical AF associated with increased
