Abstract
Background: Although designed as a consumer product to help motivate individuals to be physically active, Fitbit activity
trackers are becoming increasingly popular as measurement tools in physical activity and health promotion research and are also
commonly used to inform health care decisions.
Objective: The objective of this review was to systematically evaluate and report measurement accuracy for Fitbit activity
trackers in controlled and free-living settings.

Text: We conducted electronic searches using PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases with a
supplementary Google Scholar search. We considered original research published in English comparing Fitbit versus a reference-
or research-standard criterion in healthy adults and those living with any health condition or disability. We assessed risk of bias
using a modification of the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments. We explored
measurement accuracy for steps, energy expenditure, sleep, time in activity, and distance using group percentage differences as
the common rubric for error comparisons. We conducted descriptive analyses for frequency of accuracy comparisons within a
±3% error in controlled and ±10% error in free-living settings and assessed for potential bias of over- or underestimation. We
secondarily explored how variations in body placement, ambulation speed, or type of activity influenced accuracy.
Results: We included 67 studies. Consistent evidence indicated that Fitbit devices were likely to meet acceptable accuracy for
step count approximately half the time, with a tendency to underestimate steps in controlled testing and overestimate steps in
free-living settings. Findings also suggested a greater tendency to provide accurate measures for steps during normal or self-paced
walking with torso placement, during jogging with wrist placement, and during slow or very slow walking with ankle placement
in adults with no mobility limitations. Consistent evidence indicated that Fitbit devices were unlikely to provide accurate measures
for energy expenditure in any testing condition. Evidence from a few studies also suggested that, compared with research-grade
accelerometers, Fitbit devices may provide similar measures for time in bed and time sleeping, while likely markedly overestimating
time spent in higher-intensity activities and underestimating distance during faster-paced ambulation. However, further accuracy
studies are warranted. Our point estimations for mean or median percentage error gave equal weighting to all accuracy comparisons,
possibly misrepresenting the true point estimate for measurement bias for some of the testing conditions we examined.

Text: Other than for measures of steps in adults with no limitations in mobility, discretion should be used when
considering the use of Fitbit devices as an outcome measurement tool in research or to inform health care decisions, as there are
seemingly a limited number of situations where the device is likely to provide accurate measurement.

Introduction
Commercially available wearable activity trackers have grown
rapidly in popularity since their introduction just over a decade
ago [1]. While the technologies behind them are quickly and
continuously changing, in general they are small devices that
are commonly worn on the wrist or attached to clothing. They
aim to provide the user with real-time feedback on various
aspects of daily activities, such as number of steps taken, energy
expenditure, time spent asleep, and time spent in different levels
of activity. They also typically provide personal goal-setting
options,

synchronization with interactive mobile- and computer-based
apps, as well as opportunities to connect to social media and
other health and fitness apps. These devices are aimed primarily
at health- and fitness-conscious consumers and are designed to
motivate and offer support to individuals to self-monitor and
increase their daily physical activity.
Fitbit (Fitbit Inc, San Francisco, CA, USA), one of the most
popular commercial wearable activity trackers, holds
approximately 20% of the market share for wearable tracking
devices, with more than 63 million devices sold worldwide in
the last 10 years [2]. In 2017, the company sold 15 million
devices and had 25 million active users [2]. The Classic model
was introduced in 2009 as a clip-on device to be worn on the
torso; new models of clip-on devices became commercially
available in 2011 with the introduction of the Ultra, Zip, and
One models. In 2013, Fitbit introduced a line of wristband
activity trackers: Force, Flex (2), Charge (2, HR), and Alta
(HR).
Fitbit devices use a microelectronic triaxial accelerometer to
capture body motion in 3-dimensional space, with these motion
data analyzed using proprietary algorithms to identify patterns
of motion to identify daily steps taken, energy expenditure,
sleep, distance covered, and time spent in different intensity of
activities. Although designed as a consumer product to help
motivate individuals to be physically active, Fitbit devices are
becoming increasingly popular as measurement tools in physical
activity and health promotion research and are also commonly
used to inform patient–health professional interactions [3-7].
Between 2011 and 2017, a total of 171 clinical trials registered
at ClinicalTrials.gov used Fitbit as an outcome measurement
tool; 97 of those were registered in the last 3 years [8]. Most of
the registered trials identified number of steps taken as the
outcome of interest, followed, in order, by time in activity, sleep,
energy expenditure, and distance covered.
Fitbit devices, and particularly the wrist-worn devices, have
demonstrated dependability, durability, and acceptability [9,10].
A 2015 systematic review by Evenson et al examined the
“validity and reliability of...[Fitbit devices] and their ability to
estimate steps, distance, physical activity, energy expenditure,
and sleep” [11]. They concluded that Fitbit devices were
moderately associated with criterion reference devices for
measures of steps, sleep, and distance, with associations varying
from poor to moderate with criterion reference devices for
measures of energy expenditure and time in activity [11]. They
also found that Fitbit had a high interdevice reliability for all
outcome measures. In addition, the review provided some data
for measurement accuracy; however, it did not comprehensively
examine device measurement accuracy or study quality.
Measurement accuracy, or how close to “true” the measured
value is, is an important consideration, as Fitbit devices are
being used as an outcome measurement tool in research and to
inform health care decisions [12,13]. Therefore, the purpose of
this review was to systematically examine and report the
accuracy of measures derived from the triaxial accelerometry
data in Fitbit devices—that is, measures of steps, energy
expenditure, sleep, distance, and time in activity—when used
by adults in controlled and free-living settings.
Methods
Search Strategy
We conducted an electronic literature search of the PubMed,
EMBASE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases, with an
additional supplementary search conducted via Google Scholar.
Keywords within each database search included variations on
the terms Fitbit AND Accuracy (accura*) OR Validity /
Validation (valid*) OR Comparison / Comparative (compar*)
OR Relationship (relation*) OR Association (associa*) Or
Equivalence (equival*) OR Agreement (Multimedia Appendix
1). We applied a language filter to limit results to English and
a date limitation from January 1, 2011 (Fitbit devices were not
commercially available prior to this date) to October 31, 2017
(the end date for our search). We applied no further search limits
or filters. We also hand searched reference lists of the included
studies for potentially eligible studies.
Study Selection and Eligibility Criteria
We screened all citations, removed duplicates, and assessed the
remaining titles and abstracts for potential eligibility. All
potentially eligible citations were retrieved for full-text review
by 2 independent reviewers (JYY, JG) with disagreements
resolved through consensus. Initial inclusion criteria were
original research studies, published in a full, short, or letter
format in English in peer-reviewed journals. We verified journal
peer-review status using a Web-based serial directory database
search (ULRICHSWEB, ProQuest LLC, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
The studies also had to include or separately report data for
adults (≥18 years old) and examine measurement accuracy for
one or more of the following outcome domains: steps, energy
expenditure, time in activity, distance, or sleep. Studies could
be conducted in any controlled-testing (ie, using a standardized
testing protocol) or free-living (ie, during usual daily activity)

Text: setting and could include individuals living with any health,
disease, or mobility or functional status. Studies examining
accuracy in controlled settings had to compare a Fitbit measure
against a predefined reference-standard criterion measure,
whereas studies conducted in free-living settings had to compare
the Fitbit measure against a predefined research-standard
criterion measure (Multimedia Appendix 2). To be included in
the final review, studies had to have extractable data for one or
more of the following accuracy analyses: group mean or
percentage differences, mean or median absolute percentage
error (MAPE), or level-of-agreement analyses [14]. We did not
contact authors if these data were not reported in the publication.
We excluded studies (or comparisons) if the accuracy
evaluations were conducted on 10 or fewer participants. We
also excluded studies (or comparisons) if they examined heart
rate accuracy, as heart rate measurement is not derived from
accelerometry data.
Data Extraction
Data were extracted and checked for accuracy by a second
independent reviewer (JYY, JG, AME, LMF) with discrepancies
resolved through discussion and consensus. Data extracted
included study, participant, and Fitbit device characteristics, as
well as details about the study setting, outcomes examined, and
reference criterion used (Multimedia Appendix 2). Group mean
or percentage difference values for the Fitbit device and criterion
groups were extracted for all accuracy comparisons reported in
each study. If group percentage difference was not reported, we
calculated group percentage error ([Fitbitmean–Criterionmean] /
Criterionmean×100) to allow for a common unit of measure
(rubric) for comparison of accuracy measures within and across
outcome domains (Multimedia Appendix 3). We also extracted
reported MAPE or level-of-agreement accuracy data when
available.
Risk-of-Bias Assessment
All articles were independently assessed for risk of bias by 2
independent reviewers (JG, CP) using a modification of the
validation subscale from the checklist for assessing the
methodological quality of studies on measurement properties
of health status measurement instruments (Consensus-Based
Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement
Instruments [COSMIN]) [15]. All discrepancies were resolved
by discussion and consensus, or by a third independent reviewer
(LMF). Quality evaluation included 5 design or methodology
components

comparison, design or methodological flaws) and one analysis
component (acceptable accuracy analyses). We rated each
dimension as excellent, good, fair, or poor quality based on a
priori modifications to the COSMIN validation subscale scoring
criteria appropriate for accuracy studies (Multimedia Appendix
4) [16].
Data Handling
We sorted each accuracy comparison into one of the following
outcome domains: (1) steps, (2) energy expenditure, (3) sleep,
(4) time in activity, or (5) distance. Within each domain, we
coded individual accuracy comparisons to identify testing
parameters that may influence measurement accuracy, such as
variations in the testing environment(s), placement of device(s),
or variations in the type of ambulation or activity or task
examined (Multimedia Appendix 5). All coding was
independently reviewed by a second reviewer with discrepancies
resolved through discussion and consensus (LMF, JG).
Syntheses
Given the diversity of outcomes reported and the variety of
testing conditions under which accuracy measures were
examined and reported across and within different studies, we
were unable to conduct meta-analyses. As an alternative, and
as recommended by the UK Economic and Social Research
Council guidelines for conducting and reporting narrative
syntheses, we conducted a narrative synthesis of quantitative
data, where we explored measurement accuracy within each
outcome domain (ie, steps, energy expenditure, sleep, time in
activity, and distance) using group percentage difference as the
common rubric for measurement error comparisons [17,18].
We performed descriptive analyses for frequency (number and
percentage) of percentage error comparisons that were within
and outside predefined cutoff points for measurement accuracy
in controlled or free-living settings. We also explored potential
trends for direction of measurement error (ie, potential
measurement bias) by defining a point estimation for both mean
and median percentage error, with negative values indicating a
trend for Fitbit device underestimation compared with the
criterion device. In addition, we explored measurement error
dispersion by defining the range (maximum–minimum) for
percentage error measures. Given the diversity of testing
conditions, we conducted further secondary exploratory analyses
for comparisons of steps and energy expenditure accuracy in
controlled settings to examine the potential influence of different
testing parameters such as variations in body placement,
ambulation speed, or variations in the type of activity on
measurement accuracy. We completed these secondary
exploratory analyses only when there were 10 or more accuracy
comparisons within each subgroup.
We provide summaries for all descriptive analyses in tabular
formats. For selected secondary subanalyses, we also provide
modified scatter plots depicting the distribution of accuracy
comparisons for group percentage error, color coded by
variations in testing parameters, to allow for visual interpretation
of how measurement error may be influenced by variations in
testing parameters.
We focused our interpretation of measurement accuracy based
on predefined acceptable limits for measurement accuracy in
controlled settings as a percentage difference of ±3% and
acceptable limits for relative accuracy in free-living settings as
a percentage difference of ±10% [19-22]. We completed all
descriptive analyses and plots using SAS version 9.4 software
(SAS Institute Inc).
In the review, we included accuracy studies not reporting data
to allow for the examination of group percentage measurement
error if they reported MAPE or level-of-agreement data. These
studies were included in the syntheses of study characteristics
and the risk-of-bias assessment. As well, we provide narrative
summaries for how the reported accuracy from these studies

Results
Study Selection
We identified 711 citations, of which we screened 516 titles
and abstracts for potential eligibility after removing duplicates.
Following screening, we excluded 275 titles, with the remaining
241 full-text reviewed. After full-text review, we subsequently
excluded 174 articles. A total of 67 studies met the final
inclusion criteria, with 57 providing adequate data for inclusion
in the quantitative analyses. Of these, 40 studies investigated
step count (laboratory: n=27; free-living settings: n=13), 21
addressed energy expenditure (laboratory: n=18; free-living
settings: n=3), 8 examined time spent in different intensities of
activity in free-living settings, 6 examined sleep measurements
(laboratory: n=3; free-living settings: n=3), and 2 examined
distance walked in a controlled testing environment (Figure 1)
[23].
Study and Participant Characteristics
Publication dates varied from 1 publication in each of 2012 and
in 2013, to 8 publications in each of 2014 and in 2015, with 49
studies published in or after 2016. Publications were from 11
countries across North America, Western Europe, South Asia,
and Australia. The largest number of publications were from
the United States (n=39), followed by Australia (n=9) and
Canada (n=5). Of the 67 publications, 61 were full research
articles, 5 were short reports, and 1 was a letter to the editor
(Multimedia Appendix 6).
The 67 studies comprised a total of 2441 participants, with the
mean number being 36 (SD 25), varying from 12 to 166. Of the
61 studies reporting age, the mean age of participants was 37
(SD 18) years, varying from 21 to 84 years. Of the 65 studies
reporting sex, 53.95% (1251/2319) of the participants were
female. A total of 55 studies included only healthy participants,
with the remaining 12 including participants living with a variety
of chronic diseases or mobility limitations, or both (Multimedia
Appendix 6). Studies used several models of Fitbit devices,
including the Ultra, Classic, Zip, or One worn on the torso
(waist, hip, or chest), the Flex, Charge HR, Force, or Surge
worn on the wrist, and the One worn on the ankle.

Text: Risk of Bias
We rated the vast majority of the 67 studies as excellent or good
for study design, reporting of missing data, and use of an
acceptable reference criterion measure (Multimedia Appendix
7). For 34 studies (43 accuracy comparisons), it was unclear
how missing data were handled in the analyses (Multimedia
Appendix 7). We did not exclude these accuracy comparisons
from the descriptive analyses of percentage measurement error
based on this criterion. However, we did exclude 21 accuracy
comparisons in the descriptive analyses, as the Fitbit versus
criterion group mean or percentage differences were not reported
(Multimedia Appendix 7). Rather than excluding these accuracy
comparisons (or studies) completely from the review, we provide
a narrative summary for how the reported MAPE or
level-of-agreement accuracy data may or may not be consistent
with our exploration of percentage measurement error.
We also did not exclude 55 studies (85 accuracy comparisons)
rated fair or poor for sample size (<50 participants), as there
were only 2 studies with 100 or more participants (excellent
rating) and 10 with 50 to 99 participants (good rating)
(Multimedia Appendix 7). Rather, we excluded studies (or
accuracy comparisons) with 10 or fewer participants. As well,
for step count and energy expenditure in controlled settings, we
explored the potential for bias based on sample size by exploring
the dispersion of group percentage error across different sample
sizes using modified scatter plots (Figure 2). In these exploratory
analyses, we saw no apparent systematic bias for measurement
error, other than a slight tendency for extreme underestimation
of steps in 4 comparisons from 2 studies with fewer than 50
participants. However, when we explored these extreme outliers
further, we determined that they were likely true reflections of
a greater tendency for underestimation of step count during very
slow walking activities when the device was worn on the torso,
rather than due to small sample size. Therefore, we included all
percentage error accuracy comparisons, independent of sample
size, in our descriptive analyses.

[12,24-49]. Of these, 21 studies recruited healthy adults with a
mean age of 37.2 (SD 18.3) years; the remaining 6 recruited
adults living with limited mobility or chronic disease with a
mean age of 64.8 (SD 14.8) years. Fitbit devices were worn on
the torso, wrist, or ankle. Across the 191 accuracy comparisons
examining step count in controlled settings, 46% (n=88) were

–3% measurement error, and 3% (n=6) were above a 3%
measurement error, with an overall tendency for Fitbit devices
to underestimate steps (estimated mean [median] difference of
–9% [–3%]) (Multimedia Appendix 8 and Figure 2).

Text: When we further explored factors potentially influencing step
count accuracy, we observed that accuracy of step count in
controlled settings seemed to vary with speed of ambulation
(jog, normal, self-paced, slow, or very slow) [50,51], with body
placement (torso, wrist, or ankle), and with variations in how
the body moved during the activity (normal, constrained,
variable, or exaggerated) (Multimedia Appendix 8). Constrained
body motion throughout the task or activity could be due to, for
example, a disease-related mobility limitation, walking with a
walking aide, or pushing a stroller while walking. Levels of
body motion could have varied while performing a series of
different simulated household tasks or doing simulated
agility-dependent sporting activities. Exaggerated motions could
have occurred when the device was worn on the wrist during
simulated household or sporting activities that involved
exaggerated arm motions.
Within the different speeds of ambulation, measurement error
was within ±3% more than 50% of the time for jogging (14/24)
or normal (25/48) ambulation speeds. More than 50% of the
time, measurement error was below –3% for self-paced (35/70),
slow (12/23), and very slow (19/26) ambulation speeds. Within
each ambulation speed, Fitbit tended to underestimate step
counts (mean [median] error estimations varying from –24%
[–12%] to –4% [–2%]) (Multimedia Appendix 8 and Figure 3).
Within the different body placements for the device,
measurement error was within ±3% more than 50% of the time
for comparisons with torso (65/114) or ankle (8/16) placement,
whereas 70% (43/61) of the time measurement error was below
–3% for wrist placement. Within each body placement, Fitbit
tended to underestimate steps (estimated mean [median] errors
varying from a –11% [–2%] to –3% [–1%]) (Multimedia
Appendix 8 and Figure 4).
Within the variations of body motion during the activity,
measurement error was within ±3% more than 50% (82/154)
of the time during activities with normal body motion.
Measurement error was below –3% more than 90% of the time
for activities that involved constrained (19/24) or variable
(10/10) body motion during the activity, with Fitbit tending to
underestimate steps during these activities (estimated mean
[median] errors varying from –35% [–26%] up to –21%
[–12%]). Conversely, when the Fitbit device was worn on the
wrist during exaggerated arm motion, 2 of the 3 comparisons
were above 3% (Multimedia Appendix 8 and Figure 5).
We also observed that, within the different speeds of ambulation,
step count accuracy appeared to be influenced further by the
placement of the device on the body (Figures 3 and 4). For torso
placement, measurement accuracy was within ±3% more than
60% of the time for normal (24/30), self-paced (28/44), and
slow (7/11) ambulation speeds. Torso placement was lower than
–3% more than 60% of the time for jogging (9/14) and more
than 90% of the time for very slow (14/15) walking speeds. In
addition, we observed that the underestimation of steps was
largest during very slow walking when the device was worn on
the torso, with 7 of these 15 comparisons having a measurement
error lower than –25%. For ankle placement, 70% (11/16) of
the accuracy comparisons were within ±3% measurement error
for slow or very slow walking speeds. There were no accuracy
comparisons for ankle placement at normal or jogging speeds
and only 1 comparison for ankle placement during self-paced
ambulation. For wrist placement, 90% (9/10) of time
measurement error was within ±3% for jogging speeds and 75%
(38/51) of the time it was lower than –3% for all other speeds.

A total of 13 studies examined Fitbit accuracy for step count in
free-living conditions (20 accuracy comparisons; Multimedia
Appendix 3) [36,52-63]. Of these, 8 studies were conducted in
healthy young adults; 5 were conducted on older adults, of
whom 3 were healthy, active older adults and 2 had mobility
limitations. Duration of wear varied from 1 to 14 days. Fitbit
devices were compared with ActiGraph, activPAL, or Actical
accelerometers, or an Omron or Shimmer pedometer.
Across the 20 accuracy comparisons examining step count in
free-living settings, 55% (n=11) were within a ±10%
measurement error, 30% (n=6) were below a –10% measurement
error, and 15% (n=3) were above a 10% measurement error,
with a tendency for Fitbit to overestimate steps in free-living
conditions relative to a research-grade criterion. When explored
further, it appeared that measurement error for step count in
free-living conditions varied depending on the reference criterion
used, body placement of the device, and the age and mobility
status of the study participants. Compared with ActiGraph or
activPAL accelerometers, Fitbit step count was within a ±10%
error for 6 of 8 torso comparisons and 3 of 5 wrist comparisons
in healthy young adults, and in 1 comparison when worn on the
torso in older adults with no mobility limitation. In 1 comparison
in older adults with no mobility limitations, a Fitbit device worn
on the torso overestimated steps by more than 35% relative to
an Omron pedometer worn on the ankle.

Text: In contrast, in 2 of 3 accuracy comparisons in older adults with
mobility limitations, Fitbit step count error was approximately
–25% lower than that of a Shimmer pedometer or an Actical
accelerometer worn on the ankle when Fitbit was worn on the
torso (Multimedia Appendix 9).
Our evaluation for step count accuracy in free-living settings
was consistent with those of 5 other studies examining MAPE
or level-of-agreement differences in daily step measures in
healthy adults for Fitbit compared with an accelerometer worn
on the torso or a pedometer worn on the ankle [42,64-67]. These
studies reported Fitbit overestimations of median steps per day
varying from 700 to 1800 steps or MAPE values greater than
10% when compared with an ActiGraph accelerometer or
Omron or New Life pedometers. In contrast, 1 study showed
similar measures for median steps per day for Fitbit compared
with a Yamax pedometer (–55 steps/day) [67].
Energy Expenditure
A total of 18 studies (98 accuracy comparisons) examined Fitbit
device energy expenditure measurement accuracy in controlled
settings compared with a reference standard of direct (2 studies)
or indirect (16 studies) calorimetry (Multimedia Appendix 3)
[29,34,37,39,46,68-80]. All 18 studies recruited healthy adults.
Fitbit devices were worn on the torso or wrist. Of the accuracy
comparisons, 88 measured energy expenditure during an activity,
while 10 measured energy expenditure at rest.
Findings indicated that, across the 88 activity comparisons,
measurement error was rarely within ±3% (4% [n=4] within a
±3% error, 47% [n=41] below a –3% error, and 49% [n=43]
above a 3% error). Overall, Fitbit showed a tendency to
overestimate energy expenditure during activity (estimated
mean [median] error of 4% [2%]). Across the 10 comparisons
at rest, 3 were within a ±3% measurement error, with 6 lower
than –3% and 1 higher than 3%, with a tendency to
underestimate energy expenditure (estimated mean [median]
error of –3% [–6%]) (Multimedia Appendix 8 and Figure 6).
When we explored further by factors potentially influencing
energy expenditure measurement accuracy, we observed that
accuracy appeared to vary with speed of ambulation, with body
placement, and with variations in body motion during the
activity. In addition, energy expenditure accuracy appeared to
be influenced by type of ambulation. Types of ambulation
included continuous ambulation on an incline or a flat surface,
as well as intermittent ambulation (stop-and-start ambulation)
while performing common simulated household or sporting
activities (Multimedia Appendix 8).
Within the different body placements, measurement error for
energy expenditure was lower than –3% more than 60% (32/52)
of the time with torso placement (estimated mean [median] error
of –5% [–8%]) and greater than 3% more than 60% (24/36) of
the time for wrist placement (estimated mean [median] error of
18% [9%]) (Multimedia Appendix 8 and Figure 7).
Within the different speeds of ambulation, more than 50% of
jogging (8/15) and normal (17/24) speed comparisons for energy
expenditure were greater than 3% (estimated mean [median]
errors varying from 7% (5%) to 18% (12%]). Conversely, more
than 50% (25/39) of the self-paced ambulation comparisons
were below –3% (estimated mean [median] error of –6% [–9%]).
There were fewer than 10 comparisons for energy expenditure
at slow and very slow ambulation speeds, with no apparent trend
or pattern for measurement error noted (Multimedia Appendix
8 and Figure 8).

Within the different body motion parameters, more than 50%

A total of 3 studies examined Fitbit device accuracy for
measures of energy expenditure in healthy adults in free-living
conditions compared with doubly labelled water (1 accuracy
comparison) or a SenseWear accelerometer (4 accuracy
comparisons; Multimedia Appendix 3) [56,77,81]. Findings
from 1 study showed that Fitbit worn on the wrist tended to
slightly underestimate (–7%) energy expenditure over 15 days
compared with doubly labelled water [77]. All 4 accuracy
comparisons with a SenseWear accelerometer were lower than
a –10% measurement error (estimated mean [median] difference
of –15% [–15%]) (Multimedia Appendix 9). These findings are
consistent with those of 2 other accuracy studies reporting Fitbit
underestimations of daily energy expenditure, with MAPE
values varying from 16% to 30% for Fitbit devices compared
with measurements from an ActiGraph or Actiheart
accelerometer [58,70].

device measures in free-living settings for time spent in different

Text: [52,53,56,57,59-62]. Of these studies, 5 were conducted on
healthy young adults and 3 were conducted on older adults
living with a variety of chronic diseases. The duration of wear
varied from 2 to 9 days. Studies examined time spent in
sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, or moderate to vigorous
physical activity during waking hours.
Notably, the Fitbit device and the reference criterion
accelerometers across the studies used variable cutoff points
for defining intensity levels of physical activity. Despite these
differences, 3 of the 4 accuracy comparisons for sedentary time
had an error lower than –10% when compared with ActiGraph
(torso) or Actical (ankle) accelerometers. Compared with Actical
(ankle) or ActiGraph (torso) accelerometers, more than 80%
(21/24) of accuracy comparisons for time spent in light to
vigorous activity time had a measurement error greater than
10% (estimated mean [median] difference varying from 44%
[52%] to 632% [390%]) (Multimedia Appendix 9).
Our observation of marked overestimation of time spent in
higher-intensity activity was consistent with those of 2 other
studies reporting Fitbit overestimations of moderate to vigorous
physical activity in free-living settings compared with an
ActiGraph accelerometer (MAPEs >30%) [58,66]. In contrast
to our finding of Fitbit underestimation of sedentary time during
the day, 1 study reported Fitbit overestimation of combined
night (sleep) and daytime sedentary time (MAPE ~10%) when
compared with an activPAL accelerometer worn on the thigh.
[66].
Sleep
A total of 3 studies examined sleep in controlled settings (12
accuracy comparisons), comparing a Fitbit worn on the wrist
against reference-standard polysomnography over 1 night of
sleeping in a laboratory (Multimedia Appendix 3) [82-84]. All
3 studies included young adults, 2 comprising healthy
participants and 1 comprising individuals living with depression.
All 3 studies examined measures of sleep in a normal-mode
setting, and all reported Fitbit overestimation of total sleep time
and sleep efficiency by more than 10%. On the other hand, 1
study examined total sleep time and sleep efficiency in the
sensitive sleep mode, reporting Fitbit underestimation of both
by more than 15% [82]. One study also examined sleep-onset
latency (minutes to initial sleep) and time awake after sleep
onset in normal and sensitive sleep modes and reported
measurement errors varying from 12% to 180%, with an
opposite tendency for either over- or underestimations of these
sleep parameters depending on the sleep-mode setting
(Multimedia Appendix 8).
A total of 3 studies (5 accuracy comparisons) reported sleep
measurement accuracy in healthy young adults in free-living
settings comparing a Fitbit device worn on the wrist with a
SenseWear or Actiwatch accelerometer also worn on the wrist
(Multimedia Appendix 3) [56,81,85]. Duration of wear varied
from 1 to 13 nights of home sleep. There were 4 comparisons
for measures of time in bed, with all 4 reporting measurement
errors within ±10% compared with a SenseWear accelerometer.
One study also reported very similar measures for time in bed
(–0.4%) by a Fitbit device compared with an Actiwatch
accelerometer. One study also reported a slight overestimate
(6%) of sleeping minutes for Fitbit compared with an Actiwatch
accelerometer [85] (Multimedia Appendix 9). These findings
are consistent with those of 2 other studies reporting Fitbit
overestimations of sleeping time compared with a portable sleep
monitor

Distance
There were 2 studies (17 accuracy comparisons) examining
Fitbit device distance measurement accuracy in a controlled
setting in healthy young adults (Multimedia Appendix 3)
[33,48]. Both studies reported a Fitbit tendency to overestimate
distance at slower and self-paced ambulation speeds (varying
from 5% [torso] to 25% [wrist]) and underestimate distance at
brisk walking or jogging speeds (varying from –15% [wrist] to
–5% [torso]). During normal speed ambulation, torso placement
tended to overestimate distance (10%), and wrist placement
tended to slightly underestimate distance (–3%). These findings
are consistent with 1 additional study reporting Fitbit
overestimations of distances at slower walking speeds varying
from 5% to 15% and underestimations of distance by more than
10% during running activities (Multimedia Appendix 8) [87].
Discussion
Principal Findings
This review adds to the existing literature, as it is the first, to
our knowledge, to systematically examine and report Fitbit
device measurement accuracy in controlled and free-living
settings for measures of step count, energy expenditure, sleep,
time in activity, and distance in healthy adults or adults living
with any health condition or disability.
Findings across many studies suggested that, approximately
50% of the time, Fitbit devices were likely to provide accurate
measures (within ±3%) of steps in controlled testing conditions,
with an overall tendency to underestimate steps. Findings also
indicated that step count accuracy was likely to improve if the
device was worn on the torso during normal or self-paced
walking activities, worn on the wrist during jogging activities,
and worn on the ankle during slow or very slow walking
activities. Findings from several studies examining step count
in free-living settings also showed that, approximately 50% of
the time, Fitbit devices were likely to provide relatively accurate
(within ±10%) measures of steps compared with research-grade
accelerometers or pedometers when worn on the torso or wrist
in healthy adults with no mobility limitations, with a tendency
to overestimate steps in free-living settings.
Consistent findings across studies in controlled-testing settings
indicated that Fitbit devices were also more likely to provide
notable underestimations of step count during activities with
very slow ambulation, particularly when worn on the torso,
where body motion may be constrained by mobility limitations
or walking while pushing a walker or stroller, and during
activities that simulate household or sporting activities that
involve stop-and-start ambulation throughout the task. Findings
from a few studies in free-living conditions suggested that,
compared with a research-grade accelerometer or pedometer
worn at the ankle, a Fitbit device worn on the torso may

limitation and markedly underestimate steps in older adults with
limited mobility.
There were also consistent findings from many studies
examining energy expenditure in controlled settings, indicating
that Fitbit devices were rarely likely to provide accurate
measures of energy expenditure. Findings suggested that Fitbit
was more likely to markedly overestimate energy expenditure
when worn on the wrist and when walking at normal adult
walking speeds on flat surfaces. On the contrary, Fitbit was
more likely to underestimate energy expenditure when worn on
the torso, with a tendency to markedly underestimate energy
expenditure during inclined ambulation, during activities with
constrained or variable body motion throughout the activity,
and during simulated household or sporting activities that
involve stop-and-start ambulation. Findings from 1 study for
measures of energy expenditure in free-living settings suggested
that Fitbit and doubly labelled water may provide similar
measures of total energy expenditure over a 2-week period.
However, findings from a few studies in free-living settings
suggested

underestimations of daily energy expenditure compared with a

A few studies examined Fitbit measurement accuracy for time
spent in different intensity of activity in free-living settings.
Across these studies, there was consistent evidence to suggest
that, compared with research-grade accelerometers, Fitbit
devices may underestimate sedentary time and progressively
overestimate time in spent in activity as intensity of activity
increases. Similarly, a few studies examined the accuracy for
measures of sleep in controlled or free-living settings. Consistent
evidence from these studies suggested that Fitbit may not
provide accurate measures of sleep quality or quantity in a
controlled-testing setting compared with polysomnography.
However, there was some indication that Fitbit may provide
relatively similar measures to SenseWear or Actiwatch
accelerometers for time spent in bed and time sleeping in
free-living settings. Finally, findings from 2 studies suggested
that Fitbit may overestimate distance with slower walking speeds
and progressively underestimate distance as walking speed
increases.
Most of the studies included in this review were published in
the last 2 years, with studies primarily examining measurement
accuracy for models of Fitbit activity trackers introduced prior
to 2015. The included studies mainly focused on step count and
energy expenditure outcome measurement accuracy, with only
a few of the studies examining measurement accuracy for sleep,
distance, or time in activity. As well, the vast majority of studies
included only healthy participants, with few including older
adults, and fewer still including any adult living with disease
or functional limitation. Overall, the quality of the included
studies was excellent in terms of study design, reporting of
missing data, and use of acceptable accuracy evaluations.
However, some studies did not clearly identify how they may
have handled missing data in their analyses, and few comprised
more than 50 participants.
Most of the studies focused on measurement accuracy in
controlled-testing environments comparing measurements from
a Fitbit device against a reference-standard criterion.
Standardized and controlled testing environments allow for
evaluations of “true” measurement accuracy but do not
necessarily reflect device measurement accuracy in uncontrolled
or free-living settings, which are the intended environments for
Fitbit activity tracker use. However, it is very difficult to
measure true device accuracy in free-living conditions, as the
reference-standard criterion measures generally cannot be used
over a number of days while someone is conducting their usual
daily activities. Therefore, the studies examining Fitbit device
measurement accuracy in free-living conditions examined the
accuracy of Fitbit device measures relative to an established
research-grade criterion device measure of the same outcome
when worn at the same time in free-living conditions.
For the purposes of this review, we defined satisfactory levels
of measurement accuracy based on previously published
standards for acceptable accuracy of step count in controlled
(±3%) and free-living (±10%) settings [19-22]. Given that we
were not able to identify published standards for accuracy of
other outcome measures, we applied these same cutoff points
for acceptable limits of measurement accuracy for all outcomes.
However, we provide details of our descriptive analyses in the
supplemental summary tables and offer visual representations
for error estimations in the figures to allow for independent
assessment of alternative definitions for acceptable limits for
measurement accuracy by Fitbit devices.
Limitations
Our review has some potential limitations. These include the
decision to include only data that were published in
peer-reviewed journals and to exclude non-English studies.
These decisions may have introduced a level of bias in our
analyses and interpretation. In addition, we included all studies,
independent of potential risk of bias. Moreover, the descriptive
analyses and subsequent point estimations for percentage
measurement error (ie, potential bias) gave equal weighting to
accuracy comparisons with different sample sizes and variations
in significance levels, which may misrepresent the true point
estimate for measurement error for some of the testing
conditions examined in this review [17,18]. Allowing for these
potential limitations, and the limited number of studies
examining Fitbit measurement accuracy for sleep, distance, and
time spent in activity, we note that discretion should be exercised
when considering our evaluations of the potential accuracy for
these outcome domains. To address this gap in the literature,
further high-quality research examining Fitbit measurement
accuracy for sleep, time in activity, and distance is warranted.
We should identify as well that defining relative (in)accuracy
of a Fitbit device in free-living settings does not define true
measurement (in)accuracy, as neither the Fitbit device nor the
reference device was compared to a reference-standard criterion.
Rather, relative inaccuracy of a Fitbit defines only the likelihood
that a Fitbit device will provide different values for measures
of the same outcome when compared with a research-grade
criterion in free-living conditions.

Text: It is also important to clarify that we derived estimates of Fitbit
device measurement accuracy in this review from studies that
used different models of Fitbit, which might have different
versions of firmware, software, and data processing algorithms.
Since the design details for the devices and software are
proprietary information, we were not able to determine whether
and what modifications have been made by the company over
time. Nonetheless, we indirectly explored the potential effect
of differences in model design over time by using body
placement for the device as a proxy, as the earlier models (eg,
Classic, One, Zip, and Ultra) were worn on the torso, whereas
the later models (eg, Flex, Charge, and Surge) were worn on
the wrist. Therefore, some of the variability in error estimations
with different body placement may be related in part to
differences in device design or in analysis protocols over time.
Finally, our finding of potential limitations in Fitbit device
measurement accuracy in a variety of testing conditions does
not imply that Fitbit device measurement accuracy will remain
static. Rather, it is very likely that accuracy will improve as
technological advances in the firmware are implemented. As
well, given the ability for Fitbit to tap into metadata from
millions of users worldwide and apply advanced algorithms to
better identify complex patterns of motion, it is likely that
evolving software upgrades will also lead to improved
measurement accuracy. Furthermore, our findings do not negate
the value of using Fitbit activity trackers in the manner for which
the devices were intended, which is for self-monitoring of
physical activity patterns and motivating individuals to achieve
their physical activity goals [88-91].
Conclusion
Fitbit devices are most likely to provide accurate measures of
steps in adults with no mobility limitations, when the device is
worn on the torso while walking at normal or self-paced walking
speeds. However, Fitbit devices are unlikely to provide accurate
measures of energy expenditure. Limited evidence suggests that
Fitbit activity trackers may not provide accurate measures for
sleep, distance, or time spent in activity; however, further
accuracy studies are warranted.
Implications
Other than for measures of steps in adults with no limitations
in mobility, discretion should be used when considering the use
of Fitbit devices as an outcome measurement tool in research
or to inform health care decisions, as there are seemingly a
limited number of situations where the device is likely to provide
accurate measurement.
