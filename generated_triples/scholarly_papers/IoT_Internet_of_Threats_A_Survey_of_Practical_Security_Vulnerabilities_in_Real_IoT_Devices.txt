Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly spreading,
reaching a multitude of different domains, including personal
health care, environmental monitoring, home automation, smart
mobility, and Industry 4.0. As a consequence, more and more
IoT devices are being deployed in a variety of public and pri-
vate environments, progressively becoming common objects of
everyday life. It is hence apparent that, in such a scenario,
cybersecurity becomes critical to avoid threats like leakage of
sensible information, denial of service (DoS) attacks, unautho-
rized network access, and so on. Unfortunately, many low-end
IoT commercial products do not usually support strong secu-
rity mechanisms, and can hence be target of—or even means
for—a number of security attacks. The aim of this article is to
provide a broad overview of the security risks in the IoT sec-
tor and to discuss some possible counteractions. To this end,
after a general introduction to security in the IoT domain, we
discuss the speciﬁc security mechanisms adopted by the most
popular IoT communication protocols. Then, we report and ana-
lyze some of the attacks against real IoT devices reported in
the literature, in order to point out the current security weak-
nesses of commercial IoT solutions and remark the importance
of considering security as an integral part in the design of IoT
systems. We conclude this article with a reasoned comparison of
the considered IoT technologies with respect to a set of qualifying
security attributes, namely integrity, anonymity, conﬁdentiality,
privacy, access control, authentication, authorization, resilience,
self organization.

I. INTRODUCTION
T
HE INTERNET of Things (IoT) is an emerging commu-
nication paradigm that aims at connecting different kinds
of objects to the Internet, in order to harvest data generated
by sensors, remotely control appliances and machines, moni-
tor environments, vehicles, and buildings, and so on [1]. The
number and variety of IoT devices have rapidly grown in the
last years, with a prediction of over 50 billions devices con-
nected to the Internet by 2020 [2]. Thanks to a plethora of new

“smart” services and products, such as smart appliances, smart
houses, smart watches, smart TVs, and so on, the IoT devices
are quickly spreading in all environments, becoming every-
day more pervasive. Moreover, many of such smart services
require users to intentionally reveal some personal (and, some-
times, private) information in change for advanced and more
personalized services. It is then clear that security and privacy
should be of primary importance in the design of IoT technolo-
gies and services. Unfortunately, this is not the case for many
IoT commercial products that are provided with inadequate,
incomplete, or ill-designed security mechanisms.
In the last years, growing attention has been dedicated
to the risks related to the use of simple IoT devices in
services that have access to sensitive information or critical
controls, such as, video recoding of private environments,
real-time personal localization, health-monitoring, building
accesses control, industrial processes, and trafﬁc lights [3], [4].
Furthermore, some security attacks against commercial IoT
devices have appeared in the mass media, contributing to raise
public awareness of the security threats associated with the IoT
world.
In order to make commercial IoT devices more resilient
to cyber attacks, security should be taken into account right
from the design stage of new products [5]. However, the wide
heterogeneity of IoT devices hinders the development of well-
established security-by-design methods for the IoT [6], [7].
The challenge is further complicated by the severe limits
in terms of energy, communication, computation, and stor-
age capabilities of many IoT devices. Such limits indeed
prevent the possibility of adopting standard security mecha-
nisms used in more traditional Internet-connected devices [8],
and call for new solutions that, however, are not yet
standardized.
Besides the technical aspects, it is also necessary to develop
a cybersecurity culture among the IoT stakeholders, in particu-
lar manufacturers and ﬁnal users. As a matter of fact, many IoT
device manufacturers come from the market of low-cost sen-
sors and actuators (e.g., home automation, lights control, video
surveillance, and so on). Such devices were originally designed
to work in isolated systems, for which the security threats are
much more limited. As a consequence, many manufacturers
do not possess a solid expertise in cybersecurity and may
be unaware of the security risks associated with connecting
their devices to a global network. Such a lack of know-how,
together with the hectic approach to the design of new prod-
ucts and the need to compress costs and time-to-market have

led to the commercialization of IoT products where security
is either neglected or treated as an afterthought [9]. In par-
allel, the ﬁnal users are also not much educated in terms of
security practices and often fail to implement even the most
basic procedures to protect their devices as, e.g., changing
the preinstalled password of the devices on ﬁrst use. Such an
underestimation of their role in protecting personal devices
makes users themselves unaware and unintentional allies of
possible attackers.
The aim of this article is hence to provide an up-to-date
vision of the current IoT cybersecurity scenario, contributing
to improve the awareness of the threats that IoT devices may
represent. To this end, this article will discuss the origins of
such threats and the possible counteractions. The problems
related to cybersecurity in IoT systems have already been
addressed by other works in the literature as, e.g., [6] and
[10]–[15]. Unlike such papers, here we address the topic from
a more practical perspective. After a quick introduction to the
cybersecurity, we focus on the speciﬁc problems of the IoT
domain, where devices may not even support basic features,
such as random number generation or standard encryption
routines. We hence consider the four communication proto-
cols mostly used in commercial IoT devices, namely ZigBee,
Bluetooth low energy (BLE), 6LoWPAN, and LoRaWAN. We
brieﬂy recall the security procedures supported by each pro-
tocol and, hence, analyze the attack surface, also reporting a
series of real attacks against popular commercial IoT devices
as examples of the risks associated with poorly designed secu-
rity mechanisms. Furthermore, we describe the processing
units, communication protocol, and cryptographic hardware
and software used in some commercial IoT devices, to offer
an idea of the solutions currently adopted in the market.
This article can then be useful to readers and practitioners
interested to grasp the more practical implications of IoT secu-
rity. Furthermore, the comparative analysis presented at the
end of this article reveals some gaps in the literature that call
for further investigation and experimentation.
Fig. 1 provides a visual representation of this article organi-
zation, which is as follows. Sections II and III are introductory
to the following analysis. More speciﬁcally, Section II recalls
the main functionalities of an IoT system and the related secu-
rity challenges, while Section III describes the main security
algorithms and protocols considered in this article. Moreover,
we will provide some details related to the implementations of
security protocols in the chipsets commonly used in commer-
cial IoT devices. Section IV is dedicated to the communication
protocols for the IoT. We brieﬂy recall the main characteris-
tics of each technology, focusing in particular on its native
security mechanisms. Then, we provide a critical analysis of
the attack surface, i.e., of the possible vulnerabilities related to
that protocol. In Section V, we report practical implementation
details of widespread IoT solutions, discussing in particular
some hardware aspect as the microcontroller and the connec-
tivity modules which have a role in determining the security
level of such devices. Finally, in Section VI, we provide a qual-
itative comparison of the devices considered in this article, and
we conclude this article with some open research directions
in Section VII.

II. SECURITY CHALLENGES IN THE IOT DOMAIN
As discussed in the remainder of this article, the attacks
against IoT devices are often simple and easy to conduct. They
could be performed in order to break user privacy and leak
personal sensible information. The collected data can indeed
range from simple room temperature and humidity measure-
ments, to more sensible information such as the heart-rate
signal, or the user’s location and living habits. Another com-
mon attack strategy consists in compromising one device in the
IoT network and use it as a beachhead to perform fraudulent
acts toward another network node [16].
In order to set a common ground for the discussion that will
follow in the next sections, here we provide a broad overview
of the IoT security requirements and of the related challenges.
A. Security Requirements
To begin with, we present a taxonomy of the security
requirements for an IoT system with respect to the different
operational levels, that is to say, at the Information, Access,
and Functional level [17], [18].
Information Level: At this level, security should guarantee
the following requirements.
1) Integrity: The received data should not been altered
during the transmission.
2) Anonymity: The identity of the data source should
remain hidden to third parties.

3) Conﬁdentiality: Data cannot be read by third parties. A
trustworthy relationship should be established between
IoT devices in order to exchange protected information.
Replicated messages must also be recognizable.
4) Privacy: The client’s private information should not be
disclosed during the data exchange. It must be hard to
infer identiﬁable information by eavesdroppers.
Access Level: It speciﬁes some security mechanisms to con-
trol the access to the network. More speciﬁcally, it provides
the following functionalities.
1) Access Control: It guarantees that only legitimate users
can access to the devices and the network for adminis-
trative tasks (e.g., remote reprogramming or control of
the IoT devices and network).
2) Authentication: It checks whether a device has the right
to access a network and whether a network has the right
to connect the device. This is likely the ﬁrst operation
carried out by a node when it joins a new network [19].
Note that devices have to provide strong authentica-
tion procedures in order to avoid security threats. For
example, if all the IoT devices produced by the same
manufacturer are conﬁgured with the same authentica-
tion credentials, then the hacking of one device may
compromise all of the security aspects at the information
level.
3) Authorization: It ensures that only the authorized devices
and the users get access to the network services or
resources.
Functional Level: This level deﬁnes the security require-
ments in terms of the following criteria.
1) Resilience: It refers to network capacity to ensure
security for its devices, even in case of attacks and
failures.
2) Self Organization: It denotes the capability of an IoT
system to adjust itself in order to remain operational
even in case of failure of some parts due to occasional
malfunctioning or malicious attacks.
B. Taxonomy of Security Attacks
Besides the requirements and mechanisms at the information,
access, and functional levels, it is important to understand
which are the vulnerabilities and the possible attacks at the
different layers of the communication stack. As explained
in [20], the communication architecture of an IoT system can
be roughly divided in Edge, Access, and Application layers.
The edge layer provides PHY and MAC functionalities for
local communications. The access layer grants the connection
to the rest of the world, usually through a gateway device
and a Middleware Layer that acts as intermediary between the
IoT world and the standard Internet. Finally, the Application
Layer takes care of the service-level data communications. In
the following we present a possible taxonomy of the attacks
that can target these communication layers.
Edge Layer: One of the main threats at this level is rep-
resented by the side channel attacks [21]. The goal of these
attacks is to leak information from the analysis of side signals,
such as power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, and
communication timing, while nodes are performing encryp-
tion procedures. Among them, the power consumption of the
devices is widely exploited to guess and recover the encryp-
tion secret keys. For each encryption operation, a power trace
can be captured: the power data is generally computed from
the voltage difference across a resistor inserted in series with
the power supply. Simple power analysis attacks try to directly
interpret the power traces related to a small number of encryp-
tion rounds. Instead, the differential power analysis is a more
effective and advanced approach: a bigger amount of traces
are statistically analyzed in order to extract additional encryp-
tion information [22]. At the edge layer, IoT devices are also
vulnerable to hardware trojan and DoS attacks that attempt
to make resources unavailable to the legitimate users, e.g.,
by forcing the device to exit sleep (low-power consumption)
mode in order to drain their batteries, or by jamming the
radio communications. Also, the device package can be tam-
pered with, e.g., to extract the cryptographic secrets of the
device, modify its software to disguise a malicious node as
a legacy one (camouﬂage), or attempt reverse engineering
to ﬁgure out the details of proprietary communication pro-
tocols and possibly reserved information (as patent-covered
algorithms).
Access/Middleware Layer: At this level the main attacks
are eavesdropping (also called snifﬁng), injection of fraudulent
packets and nonauthorized conversations. Even routing attacks
have to be taken into account: an attacker may use this kind
of attack to spoof, redirect, misdirect, or drop data packets.
Application Layer: Attacks at the Application Layer are
quite different from the previous ones, since they directly
target the software running on the devices rather than the com-
munication technology. Such attacks may address the integrity
of, e.g., machine learning algorithms, where the attacker
manipulates the training process of the learning algorithm to
induce misbehaviors. There can also be attacks on the login
and authentication phases.
Fremantle and Scott [17] and Mosenia and Jha [23]
presented an in-depth analysis of all these aspects, where they
discuss some of the major vulnerabilities presented above,
proposing solutions at different layers, from the device side
to the cloud services.
In [24], the possible attacks against IoT devices are
presented from a different standpoint, i.e., by considering how
an attacker can exploit the IoT device for malicious purposes.
The authors identify four possible approaches, as detailed
below.
Ignoring the Functionality: This class includes all the
attacks in which the speciﬁc functionalities of the IoT device
are ignored, and only its capability to connect to the local area
network (LAN) or to the Internet is exploited. For example,
IoT devices can be used to create a bot-net (a network com-
pletely controlled by the attacker) or to penetrate the victim’s
home network and infect his/her computers.
Reducing the Functionality: In this case, the attacker tries
to kill or limit the functionalities of the device, in order to
annoy the victim or create malfunctions in a wider system. For
example, this type of attack may be directed to IoT devices
like smart TVs or smart refrigerators, with the aim of blocking

or limiting their functioning in order to extort money from the
victim for restoring their normal behavior.
Misusing the Functionality: The normal functionalities of
the IoT devices are used to create discomfort to its owner.
For example, an attacker may tamper a heating, ventilation,
and air-conditioning (HVAC) control unit and make a cer-
tain environment uncomfortable by excessively increasing or
decreasing the temperature. Similarly, the attack may target a
smart light system, getting remote control over the lights in a
room or building, overwriting the victims’ commands.
Extending the Functionality: The IoT device is used to
achieve completely different functionalities. For example, a
presence sensor of an alarm system may be used to track the
position of the victims in their living environment, even when
the alarm system is off.
III. MAIN SECURITY MECHANISMS FOR IOT SERVICES
In this section, we present standard security mechanisms
that have been designed to satisfy the requirements described
in the previous section.
Encryption: It is the main and most important operation to
ensure conﬁdentiality during the communication. It consists
in changing the actual message (plaintext) into a different one
(ciphertext) using a hash function that can be easily reverted
only knowing a secret key. Using encryption, a possible eaves-
dropper can only have access to the ciphertext, but should not
be able to interpret the content of the message. The encryption
mechanism can be symmetric or asymmetric. In symmetric
encryption, the same secret key is used both for message
encryption and decryption, and hence it must be known by
both the sender and the receiver. In the asymmetric case, each
endpoint needs to possess its own pair of keys: a public key
and the associated private key, which cannot be easily derived
from the public one. The public key can be known to anyone,
while the private key should be kept secret. The public and pri-
vate keys are designed in a way that a message encrypted with
the former can only be decrypted with the latter. Therefore,
to guarantee conﬁdentiality, the message is encrypted by the
sender by using the public key of the receiver, which can then
recover the original message by using its own private key.
Standard Encryption Mechanisms: The encryption pro-
cess can be performed in two different ways: through a stream
cipher, encrypting the plaintext bit-by-bit (or byte-by-byte) or
with a block cipher, treating a block of plaintext as a whole
and producing a block of ciphertext of equal length [25]. To
encode long messages, block ciphers can be used in different
operating modes: electronic CodeBook (ECB); cipher block
chaining (CBC); cipher FeedBack (CFB); output FeedBack
(OFB); and counter (see [26] for details).
One of the most used block cipher for symmetric encryp-
tion is the advanced encryption standard (AES) (or Rijndael),
published in 2001 by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) [27]. AES is obtained through the cascade
of N successive series of three elementary block ciphers: a
substitution cipher, a transposition cipher, and a linear cipher.
Fig. 2 shows the ﬁrst three blocks of the chain, which are
repeated to obtain the ﬁnal encryption. Depending on the
Fig. 2.
Encryption for the AES block cipher. The three blocks, substitution
(S), transposition (T), and linear (L) ciphers, are repeated to obtain the ﬁnal
encryption. In the diagram, k0 and k1 are the lower and upper parts of the
encryption key, u denotes a block of plaintext to be encrypted, and the other
symbols represent the block after each encryption module.
length (in number of bits) of the key, the algorithm takes the
name of AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256.
Examples of asymmetric cryptosystems are the Rivest
Shamir Adleman (RSA) [28], the McEliece [29] and the
Elgamal [30] algorithms.
Encryption can also be used to provide authentication and
integrity protection, but in most cases these functionalities
require additional mechanisms, in particular in IoT systems.
In practice, authentication and integrity protection are pro-
vided by means of message authentication codes (symmetric
mechanisms), digital signatures (asymmetric mechanisms),
and hash functions. For what concerns message authentication
codes and digital signatures, the transmitted message is the
result of the concatenation of the plaintext and a tag computed
from the plaintext using the private key. At the receiver side,
a tag is computed using the private or public key (depending
on whether we opted for a symmetric or asymmetric process)
and it is compared to the transmitted tag.
For example, many IoT services require to broadcast
the same message to many destinations. If the message is
encrypted by the transmitter, all the destinations need to
decrypt the ciphertext to check the authenticity of the sender
and retrieve the message. This operation requires time and
drains energy from the device battery. If conﬁdentiality is not
an issue, a better solution may consist in sending the mes-
sage in plaintext, attached with a tag that identiﬁes the sender.
The veriﬁcation of the message authenticity can then be per-
formed by one designated and trusted receiver, while all the
other nodes can just read the message, without wasting time
and resources [25].
The tag is usually obtained by using a good encryp-
tion function, such as AES, as in the cipher block chaining
message authentication code (CBC-MAC) symmetric mech-
anism [31]. An asymmetric mechanism for tag computation
is the digital signature algorithm (DSA), part of the ElGamal
signatures family, published in 1991 by NIST with the federal
information processing standard (FIPS) 186 [32], and revised
multiple times in the following years. In 2009, for example,
FIPS 186 included the elliptic curve DSA (ECDSA). An alter-
native asymmetric mechanism is RSA [28], which implements
hash functions other than those of the previous two mech-
anisms. In fact, such hash functions map messages of any
length into ﬁxed length hash values, which are then transmitted
with the messages. The hash functions are practically con-
structed through a Merkle–Damgard scheme [33], [34]. The
most known functions are: MD-5 that produces a 128-bit hash,

SHA-1 with a 160-bit hash, and SHA-256 and SHA-512 that
produce 256 and 512-bit hash, respectively.
For what concerns IoT applications, the constrained appli-
cation protocol (CoAP), deﬁned by IETF in RFC 7252 [35],
recommends to use the AES Counter with CBC-MAC, which
is compactly indicated as AES-CCM. This mechanisms makes
use of 128 bit keys and generate 8 bit authentication tags. The
ephemeral elliptic curve Difﬁe Hellman (ECDHE) method is
instead recommended for key establishment, and the ECDSA
for authentication.
Lightweight Cryptography: Given the growth of the num-
ber of connected, low-complexity IoT devices, the research
community has tried to design speciﬁc security algorithms for
resource and energy constrained devices. Lightweight cryp-
tography is a new branch of cryptography that focuses on
these aspects, including new encryption block and stream
ciphers, message authentication codes, and hash functions,
which are conceived to be executed by devices with limited
computation, communication, and storage capabilities. In 2012
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) pub-
lished the ISO/IEC 29192 standard that speciﬁes a series of
lightweight encryption mechanisms [36], included the block
ciphers PRESENT [17] and CLEIFA [18]. PRINCE is another
lightweight block cipher, not included in the standard [37].
Moreover, the Simon and Speck families of lightweight
block cipher were presented by Beaulieu et al. [38]. As
lightweight hash function, ISO/IEC 29192 standard proposed
PHOTON [39] and SPONGENT [40]. In 2013 NIST started a
lightweight cryptography project to investigate and develop
solutions for real-world applications. At the beginning of
2019 NIST has published a call for algorithms for lightweight
cryptography: after discussion and evaluation, the algorithms
will go through a standardization process [41].
Random Number Generators: An important aspect for
security is the randomness: security protocols frequently
require the generation of (pseudo)random numbers for differ-
ent purposes as, e.g., to create nonces during the authentication
phase, to avoid replay attacks, and to generate asymmetric
keys [42]. A random number generator is cryptographically
secure when it produces a sequence for which no algorithm
can predict in polynomial time the next bit of the sequence
from the previous bits, with a probability signiﬁcantly greater
than (1/2). According to Shannon’s mathematical theory of
communication, the entropy of a k-bit long (pseudo)random
sequence must be as close as possible to k.
Two types of random number generators are commonly
used for cryptographic applications: 1) the true random num-
ber generator (TRNG) that exploits physical noise sources and
2) the pseudo random number generator (PRNG) that expands
a relatively short key into a long sequence of seemingly ran-
dom bits, using a deterministic algorithm. PRNGs are typically
used in real applications and technologies. In this case, since
the adopted algorithms are usually known, the seed of the
pseudorandom generator is the only source of randomness
and, as such, it must be properly selected. A common way
to generate random seeds is by exploiting different physical
phenomena, such as the timing of user processes, or the ther-
mal noise measured by the radio receiver [43]. For example,
a source of random seeds may be obtained by feeding the
noise signal of the radio power ampliﬁer into the quantizer,
which will then generate a stream of (ideally) independent bits.
However, due to bandwidth restrictions, temperature bias, and
other unavoidable factors, the bitstream may show a certain
level of correlation.
Unfortunately, most of the source of randomness avail-
able in laptops and desktop PCs are not available in low-end
embedded systems, such as the devices that will be ana-
lyzed in the following section. For this reason, the research
has recently addressed the challenge of designing lightweight
PRNG algorithms for resource constrained devices [44]–[46].
Secure Hardware: As discussed in the previous section,
IoT devices are vulnerable to edge layer attacks. Most of the
devices can be deployed in remote areas with a low level of
protection so that an illegitimate user can perform side chan-
nel attacks. Several countermeasures have been proposed in
the literature, based on the different encryption schemes. It
is possible to exploit both hardware and software solutions to
eliminate or, at least, randomize the signals footprint exploited
by this type of attacks.
For example, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) can
be adopted to improve hardware security [47]. The basic con-
cept of PUF is to exploit little differences introduced by the
fabrication process of the chip to generate a unique signature
of each device. A PUF circuit provides a response to a given
input challenge and, due to the intrinsic hardware differences,
the responses are chip speciﬁc. As an example, an Arbiter
PUF circuit is composed of two supposedly identical paths:
for each input, the output depends on the fastest path [48].
Majzoobi et al. [49] proposed the lightweight secure PUFs
concept, in which the response generation is resistant against
reverse engineering attacks that try to emulate the PUF by
parametrically modeling its behavior.
PUFs can be categorized into strong and weak [50]. If a
PUF can support a number of challenge-response pairs that
are exponential in the number of challenge bits, it is called
strong PUF. Strong PUFs are typically used for authentication
protocols that require new pairs for each operation. Arbiter
PUF belongs to this category. On the other hand, weak PUFs
can support a small number of challenge-response pairs and
they are used for cryptographic key generation, avoiding the
need to store secure keys on the devices. An example of weak
PUF is the ring-oscillator described in [51].
Other hardware solutions to prevent side channel anal-
ysis attacks can be found in the literature: a hardware
implementation of the SIMON algorithm is presented in [21],
while a method to randomize the instruction execution cycles
is shown in [52]. A software countermeasure is reported in [53]
based on the randomization of a parameter used in RSA
signature.
Anyway, all these techniques have some drawbacks, as the
increase of power consumption of the device and the increase
of the chip area. Because of the resource constraints of the IoT
edge devices, it could be very hard to ﬁnd effective solutions.

Intrusion Detection Systems: As discussed above, differ-
ent security mechanisms have been proposed to protect the
devices against threats at the different layers. However, besides
preventing the attacks, it is also fundamental to be able to
detect ongoing attacks. Complex anti-virus software and traf-
ﬁc analyzers cannot be used in IoT devices, due to resource
and energy constraints. For this, lightweight intrusion detec-
tion methods have been presented in the last years [54]. For
example, anomalies in system parameters, like CPU usage,
memory consumption, and network throughput, may be indica-
tive of an ongoing attack [55]. A similar approach is proposed
in [56]: the energy proﬁle is analyzed to detect anomalies
in power consumption, which are linked to different types of
attacks. In [57], the signatures of various attacks are derived
from relevant features like packet dropping/send rate and sig-
nal strength intensity. Comparing the trafﬁc pattern with these
signatures, the attacks can be detected with good probability.
Machine learning can also be exploited for intrusion detection
purposes. In [58], for example, a random forest classiﬁcation
algorithm is used to group the trafﬁc ﬂows into different cate-
gories, based on some selected features. An attack is detected
when some ﬂows exhibit nonstandard patterns and are hence
classiﬁed as anomalous.
IV. SECURITY OF POPULAR IOT COMMUNICATION
TECHNOLOGIES
As discussed in the previous sections, most of the legacy
security protocols used in the standard Internet cannot be
plainly applied to the IoT scenario, because of the constraints
of many IoT devices in terms of computational, power, and
communication capabilities [59]. Therefore, new mechanisms
speciﬁcally designed for the IoT scenario have been proposed
in the literature and implemented in some commercial IoT
systems.
In this section, we focus on the security mechanisms imple-
mented by some of the most popular transmission technologies
used in the IoT domain, namely ZigBee, BLE, 6LoWPAN, and
LoRaWAN. Moreover, we review the security vulnerabilities
of these technologies, reporting different attack vectors found
in the literature.
Among these technologies, ZigBee, BLE, and 6LoWPAN
are predominantly used for short-range communications in
homes or small ofﬁces. LoRaWAN instead is used for
long-range scenarios, such as city-wide monitoring and con-
trol applications. From a protocol stack perspective, while
ZigBee and BLE are full-stack technologies, 6LoWPAN and
LoRaWAN cover only some layers of the stack, and therefore
can be potentially used in the most diverse applications.
A. ZigBee
Description: ZigBee [60] is a two-way, wireless commu-
nication standard developed by the ZigBee Alliance. Thanks
to its low cost and low power consumption, ZigBee is one of
the most used technology to connect IoT devices. As shown
in Fig. 3, the standard speciﬁes the application and network
layers (NWK), while the link and physical layers are taken
from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard [61]. In more detail, the
Fig. 3.
ZigBee protocol stack. The technical speciﬁcations for ZigBee can
be found in [60].
Application Layer (APL) provides the data transmission and
security services, and permits to bind the devices to two
or more application entities located on the same network.
The NWK provides functionalities such as routing, security,
and conﬁguration of new devices. The NWK also manages
the establishment of new connections, the joining and leav-
ing procedures, and the addressing and neighbor discovery
services.
ZigBee includes different application proﬁles that deﬁne
message formats and functional procedures to guarantee ven-
dors interoperability [60].
Communications, secrecy, and authentication services are
provided by message encryption and authentication, using
AES in the counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode. Integrity
protection is ensured by a 128 bit message integrity code
(MIC) and replay protection is based on a 4 Byte frame
counter.
Each ZigBee network includes a Trust Center, i.e., a device
trusted by all the other nodes in the network. The trust cen-
ter usually corresponds to the network coordinator and is
responsible for 1) authenticating the devices that require to
join the network; 2) deciding whether to accept or deny the
join request; 3) maintaining and distributing network keys; and
4) enabling end-to-end security between devices.
The ZigBee network can either have a star topology, where
the end-devices are directly connected to the coordinator, or
a tree topology, when the interconnection is performed by
intermediate routers. By interconnecting the routers, further-
more, it is possible to realize a mesh topology, as shown in
Fig. 4.
The cryptographic routines used in ZigBee employ two
128 bit keys: the link key and the network key. The link key is
used to secure unicast communications between APL entities.
Each unicast communication uses a different link key, which
is disclosed to the two linked entities only. The network key
is needed for broadcast communications: it is shared among
all the devices in the same network.
There are different ways for a device to acquire the required
link or network key [62].
1) Preinstallation: The link or network key is installed in
the device during the manufacturing process.
2) Key Transport: The link or network key is generated
elsewhere (usually by the Trust Center) and then com-
municated to the device. The standard suggests to load
the key using an out-of-band technique, however, it

includes the possibility to send the key in-band. In the
latter case, the key may be sent in clear text or encrypted
using a preshared key speciﬁc for each application pro-
ﬁle. For example, for home automation devices, the
preshared key is deﬁned in the ZigBee standard and is
publicly available. For ZigBee light link (ZLL) devices,
instead, the preshared key will be distributed only to
certiﬁed manufacturers and is bound with a safekeep-
ing contract, according to the ZLL speciﬁcation [63].
However, it has been leaked on the Internet in 2015, so
it is now publicly known [62], [64].
3) Key Establishment: Through this process, a link key Li
is shared between the Trust Center and another device
in the network for securing the communications between
them. The procedure starts with the exchange of a trusted
information, the master key, preinstalled during the man-
ufacturing process. The master key is provided by the
ZigBee Alliance to its members and is different for each
application proﬁle. After this phase, the device and the
trust center exchange ephemeral data that are used to
derive Li. When two devices i and j need to commu-
nicate with each other, the Trust Center provides them
with a link key Li,j, encrypted using the link keys Li and
Lj, respectively. Note that this method cannot be used to
generate network keys.
The process through which a new ZigBee network is set
up or a new ZigBee device is added to an existing network is
called commissioning. In addition to the commissioning proce-
dures speciﬁc of the different application proﬁles, the ZigBee
standard also speciﬁes a common procedure that makes it
possible to interconnect devices with different proﬁles.
Attack Surface: A possible attack vector in ZigBee network
consists in discovering the keys used to secure the communi-
cations. For example, the repeated encryption of known and
ﬁxed messages (e.g., control messages deﬁned in the stan-
dard) makes the system vulnerable to plaintext attacks [62].
This technique enables the recovery of a cryptographic key by
having access to both the encrypted and decrypted messages.
Hence, to ensure a high security level, the network key needs
to be changed periodically.
A sinkhole attack against a ZigBee network is presented
in [65]. The attack is performed through a malicious entity
that legally joins the network, but then pretends to have an

efﬁcient routing path toward the coordinator in order to attract
more trafﬁc ﬂows. In this way, the attacker can modify or drop
incoming packets. Moreover, if the malicious entity is directly
connected to the Internet, all the ZigBee network is exposed
to Internet attacks.
The sinkhole attack, however, requires that the malicious
node is able to connect to the network and communicate with
the other nodes. The ghost attack presented in [66], instead,
does not require any knowledge of the communication keys.
Its aim is to drain the ZigBee node energy, increasing the
success probability of other DoS attacks. The strategy con-
sists in injecting fake messages with increasing frame counters
into the network, impersonating one legitimate node. At the
receiver side, if the fake message counter is larger than that
stored for the sending node, the counter is updated and the
message is accepted and processed. Even if the message will
be dropped during the integrity check, the node consumes
some energy for the processing. The attack will also inﬂate the
frame counter at the receiver, possibly creating a misalignment
with the counter at the legitimate source, whose messages may
be misinterpreted as duplicate and then disregarded.
Finally, KillerBee is a practical tool for hacking ZigBee
devices [67]. The framework makes it possible to sniff and
inject trafﬁc in a ZigBee network as well as decode and manip-
ulate packets. In [68], some attacks that exploit this tool, like
replay attacks, are presented.
Other attack vectors are speciﬁc to ZLL installations.
In 2012, LIFX and Philips presented their ﬁrst smart lights
solutions and, afterward, many other companies developed
similar connected light systems. Many vendors, such as
Philips, use the ZLL application proﬁle. A general smart light
system architecture is presented in Fig. 5.
Based on several reports, however, many smart light systems
implement only the essential security mechanisms required
to obtain the ZigBee Alliance’s certiﬁcation [64]. At a ﬁrst
analysis, it may seem unnecessary to implement many secu-
rity precautions in a light system, since it does not involve
the transmission of conﬁdential information, and can still be
operated manually in case the network does not work properly.
However, as explained above, attackers may use these devices
to relay an attack to the rest of the home or corporate network,
bringing more critical devices at risk.
Morgner et al. [64] investigated the security level in three
different ZigBee smart light systems, namely Osram Lightify,
GE Link, and Philips Hue. The study evaluates vulnerabil-
ities of both bulbs and interconnected devices, and reports

seven different types of attack. The attacks are based on the
inter-PAN frames, which are used to transmit touchlink com-
missioning commands such as scan request and scan response.
These frames are neither secured nor authenticated: a mali-
cious entity can send the same commands pretending to belong
to the network. The attacker can then do illicit operations,
compromising the security of the network, as better explained
next.
1) Active Device Scan: The scan searches for ZLL devices
in the range of the attacker, sending scan requests
on different channels. By listening to the correspond-
ing scan responses, the attacker can obtain a complete
overview of the devices connected to the network. The
three analyzed systems exhibit different behaviors: a) all
light bulbs and controller from lightly respond to the
attacker’s scan request; b) the GE link controller does
not respond; and c) the hue controller responds only
if its Touchlink commissioning button has been pushed
within the last 30 s.
2) Blink Attack: This attack can be activated after a device
scan by sending to the victim device the inter-PAN com-
mand identify request. In this way, the device starts to
blink for a default period. The identify request command
is implemented in all the three lightbulb systems to allow
the user to visually identify which device has a certain
network address. As a consequence, all the systems are
vulnerable to the blink attack.
3) Reset Attack:. The attacker performs a device scan and
then resets them all to the factory state by sending the
inter-PAN command reset to factory new request. All
devices of the three lightbulb systems are vulnerable to
this attack.
4) DoS Attack and Hijack Attack: In these attacks, the end
user loses control of the victim device. Two strategies
can be adopted for DoS attacks. The ﬁrst consists of
forcing the device to change the transmission channel,
sending a network update request inter-PAN command
including the new channel. As a second option, the
attacker can cause the device to join a nonexisting
network, changing its network key with arbitrary bytes.
This is possible by sending the inter-PAN command
network join end-device request: at the reception of
the command, the device leaves its current network,
changing its parameters according to the new conﬁgu-
ration. The hijack attack works similarly to this second
approach, with the difference that it forces the device to
join an existing network chosen by the attacker. In this
case, the network key of the desired network is used.
All the evaluated smart light systems are vulnerable
to DoS and hijack attacks. However, all of them inte-
grate user functions to reobtain control over the attacked
devices.
5) Network Key Extraction Attack: This attack makes it
possible to ﬁnd the current network key by eavesdrop-
ping the messages exchanged by the devices during
the touchlink commissioning procedure. A preliminary
DoS attack is needed to disconnect the device from
the network. After that, the victim device will start a
commissioning procedure in order to regain access to the
network. Therefore, the attacker can extract the network
key from the network join end-device request. In fact, as
mentioned, the network key is encrypted using the well
known master key. Only Philips hue devices are vul-
nerable to this attack since the touchlink commissioning
procedure is not enabled in the other devices.
6) Inject Commands Attack: This attack makes it possible
to send commands to the devices in order to control their
actions. The knowledge of the current network key is
needed (e.g., via the execution of the previous attacks).
All the analyzed smart light systems are vulnerable to
this attack.
B. Bluetooth Low Energy
Description: Bluetooth is a widely used short range wire-
less communication protocol. Its low energy and IoT-tailored
version, named BLE, has been ﬁrst introduced in the Bluetooth
core speciﬁcation version 4.0 [69].
A BLE network is composed of two types of devices:
masters and slaves. The masters act as initiators during the
communication setup and the slaves associate to them [70].
The entities are connected in a star topology, where each slave
is associated with a single master, as exempliﬁed in Fig. 6.
BLE operates in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band and uses
40 channels with a 2 MHz spacing [70]. The physical layer
data rate is 1 Mb/s and the coverage range is typically over
various tens of meters. The BLE MAC layer is split into two
parts: advertising and data communication. 37 of the avail-
able channels are used during the transmission of data and
the remaining 3 are used by unconnected entities to broadcast
device information and establish connections [71].
In the data communication phase, data is normally sent
in bursts to save energy. In this way, slaves can remain in
sleep mode for long periods, waking up periodically to lis-
ten to the channel for possible messages from the master.
The master decides the rendezvous instants with the slaves,
according to a time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme.
Communication reliability is provided through a stop and wait
(S&W) automatic packet retransmission mechanism, based on
cumulative acknowledgments.
As depicted in Fig. 7, besides physical and MAC layers, the
stack entails other protocols such as the logical link control
and adaptation protocol (L2CAP), and the low energy attribute
protocol (ATT).
BLE encryption and authentication processes are based on
AES-CCM with 128 bit keys, as for ZigBee. The symmetric
key for a master–slave link is generated during the pairing
procedure, which is executed as follows.
1) The devices exchange their authentication capabilities
and requirements. This phase is completely unencrypted.
2) The devices generate or exchange a temporary key (TK)
using one of the available pairing methods. Then they
exchange some values to conﬁrm that the TK is the same
for both devices. After that, a short term key (STK) is
generated from the TK. The STK will be used to encrypt
the data stream.

BLE protocol stack. The technical speciﬁcations for BLE can be

Finally, a bonding phase may optionally follow the pairing
procedure: in this, the devices exchange and store common
link keys (i.e., bonds) that can be reused when a link between
the two devices is re-established at a later time.
The available pairing methods are the following three.
1) Just Works: The TK is set to 0. Of course, this does not
provide any level of security.
2) Out of Band: The TK is exchanged out-of-band, e.g.,
using near ﬁeld communication. This method provides
a security level that is as high as that of the out-of-band
method used to exchange the key. However, it can be
inconvenient for the user.
3) Passkey: The TK is a six digit number that the user
passes between the devices. For example, one of the
devices generates the number and show it on a display:
the user must then input the same number to the other
device. In this case, the security level is high, but the
devices need to be equipped with user’s interfaces that
make it possible to read and type-in the TK, which may
be impractical for miniaturized IoT devices.
Starting from BLE version 4.2, a new pairing procedure has
been put in place, using elliptic curve cryptography.
1) Each
device
generates
an
elliptic
curve
Difﬁe

(ECDH)
public-private
key
pair.
Then,
they exchange the public key with each other and
derive a key, called DHKey, from their own secret key
and the public key of the other device, using elliptic
curve functions.
2) The devices use one of the available pairing methods
(see below) to conﬁrm that DHKey is the same for both
of them and to generate a long term key (LTK) that will
be used to symmetrically encrypt the data stream.
3) Optionally, the devices can perform a ﬁnal step, like that
for BLE version 4.1.
The pairing methods have also been updated, with the intro-
duction of a new option and the hardening of the methods in
the previous version.
1) Just Works: The noninitiating device generates a nonce
and a conﬁrmation value Cb, function of the nonce
and the public keys of the two devices. The Cb and
the nonce are then sent to the initiating device. The
latter generates its own nonce and sends it to the non-
initiating device. It also uses the noninitiating devices
nonce and the public keys to check whether the received
code Cb is valid. Clearly, this does not provide any
security, since an attacker may generate its own nonce
and use the public keys to create a valid conﬁrmation
value.
2) Numeric Comparison: This method is as just works, but
the devices also generate a value which is function of the
public keys and the nonces. This value must be displayed
to the user, which must manually conﬁrm that the shown
number is the same in both devices. This last step solves
the issue with the previous method.
3) Out of Band: With this method, random numbers and
commitment values, which are functions of the random
numbers and public keys, are exchanged in an out-
of-band fashion, e.g., using near ﬁeld communication.
Using this method, the security level achieved is equal
to the integrity and secrecy of the out-of-band method
of choice.
4) Passkey: In this method, the user ﬁrst inputs a k bit
long secret passkey to both devices (or reads it from
one of the devices and inputs it to the other). Then, for
each bit i = 1, . . . , k of the passkey, the devices must
perform a two-step procedure: a) each device generates
a nonce and computes a commitment value, which is
function of the nonce, the passkey, and the public keys.
Commitments and nonces are then exchanged between
devices. b) after that, each device recalculates the com-
mitments as before, but exchanging the order of the two
public keys, and using the nonce of the other device. If
the passkey is the same, the commitment value must be
equal to that found before.
The use of elliptic curve cryptography, however, is not with-
out drawbacks: based on the experimental results presented
in [72], the energy consumed to perform a single ECDH-
ECDSA key exchange is more than 6000 times larger than that
required by symmetric encryption techniques (236 mJ versus
38 µJ).
Attack Surface: The pairing methods just described have
some important security issues. In BLE 4.0 and 4.1, there is
no protection to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks
during the pairing phase, except for the out of band pairing. In
fact, in the Just Works pairing method the key is known, while
in the Passkey method the key is easily brute-forced. In some
cases, brute-force is not even required [73]–[77]. BLE 4.2 is
affected by similar problems, principally for the Passkey pair-
ing, since the passkey is veriﬁed one bit at a time [77], [78].
When the attacker is interested in eavesdropping, it can try

to match the conﬁrmation value considering the current bit
ri of the key equal to 0. If the conﬁrmation value does not
match, then ri = 1. When trying to directly connect to a
device, instead, the attacker can consider ri = 0. If the other
device aborts the procedure, then ri = 1. This procedure can
be repeated for bit i = 1, . . . , k, learning, therefore, the entire
key.
Another issue is linked to the advertise mode of BLE
devices. Das et al. [71] found that the analyzed ﬁtness track-
ers are almost always in advertise mode. This is because the
master device frequently disconnects from the tracker in order
to preserve energy. Therefore, when the smartphone applica-
tion for the ﬁtness tracker is not running, the tracker closes
its communication link, remaining in advertise mode until the
next connection establishment. Also, most of the devices ana-
lyzed in [71] always expose the same MAC address. This
makes it possible to capture exchanged messages and corre-
late over a long period of time the BLE trafﬁc between a
pair of devices. As an example, an attacker may be able to
track the movements of the BLE device owner or even just
verify its presence in an area. Furthermore, this attack may
be used to track the user’s activity: in fact, even though the
packets are encrypted, the volume of data exchanged is a clear
indicator of user’s motions, as exempliﬁed in Figs. 8 and 9.
The ﬁgures show the difference between the BLE data trafﬁc
exchanged by a tracker and a smartphone for a resting and
a running user. As a security feature, the BLE speciﬁcations
allow a device to use random MAC addresses and to frequently
change them. For example, the Apple Watch randomizes the
MAC address both when it is rebooted and during normal
usage at an approximately 10 min interval [79].
Arias et al. [80] described another type of attack that could
be conducted against wearable ﬁtness devices. This is based
on ﬁrmware hacking, which is possible only if the attacker
has physical access to the device. The device considered, a
Nike+ Fuelband, contains a standard USB connector used for
charging and synchronizing with the computer. This connec-
tor is also used by the manufacturer to write the ﬁrmware
into the device memory. Using the same USB port, it is pos-
sible to send commands to the STM32 microcontroller in the
device, enabling unrestricted read and write operations into the
memory. Therefore, it is possible to ﬂash a tampered ﬁrmware
version and disable all protection mechanisms. The possi-
ble consequences of a ﬁrmware attack like this could range
from the possibility of a back-door injection, in order to leak
user information or credentials, to the installation of rogue
services allowing for full remote control of the device by the
attacker.
Furthermore, the analysis in [79] shows that, in most cases,
ﬁtness tracking applications transmit every logged event over
the Internet, and in some cases, it is even unclear why such
transmissions are occurring. This allows an attacker to per-
form data analysis on the amount of exchanged data. On top
of that, the authors found that Garmin devices do not use an
encrypted protocol to transmit data between the mobile device
and the Garmin servers, except during the account creation
phase. By exploiting this vulnerability, a man-in-the-middle
attack is able to capture e-mail addresses and session identi-
ﬁers, which are transmitted in clear-text. A similar result is
presented in [81], using FitBit devices: in this case, login
credentials are forwarded in clear-text in an HTTP POST
request.
At DEF CON 2016, researchers presented several security
vulnerabilities of a large number of door lock and padlock
devices that use BLE to communicate with the user’s smart-
phone [82], [83]. They found that the passwords of devices
like Quicklock Door lock, Quicklock Padlock, and iBluLock
Padlock are transmitted in clear text and hence can be easily
eavesdropped. Other devices use passwords composed by a
small number of characters, making brute force attacks feasi-
ble. The Ceomate Bluetooth Smart Door lock and other devices
are vulnerable to replay attacks due to the bad implementa-
tion of the encryption mechanisms. The Okidokey Smart Door
lock can be opened by just changing the value of one byte
that brings the door lock in an error state, forcing it to open.
The Mesh Motion Bitlock Padlock is vulnerable to man-in-the-
middle attack: the attacker is able to impersonate the lock to
steal the password sent by the user’s smartphone. The vul-
nerabilities of the August door lock are investigated in [84]
and [85]. However, August seems to be very proactive to ﬁx
the discovered issues: when in 2015 the hard-coded encryption
key was revealed, the code was patched in 24 h [86].
Finally, as for ZigBee, attack softwares can also be found
for BLE. For example, GATTack enables to break different
aspects of the BLE security [87].
C. 6LoWPAN and CoAP
Description: 6LoWPAN and CoAP are two IETF proto-
cols that can be implemented in IoT devices to ease their
interaction with standard IP-based systems. As illustrated in
Fig. 10, 6LowPAN is an IPv6 adaptation protocol for resource-
constrained devices that communicate over low power and

lossy links, such as IEEE 802.15.4 [88], [89]. 6LowPAN
makes use of compression and fragmentation mechanisms to
reduce the size of the IP datagrams and remove most of
redundant ﬁelds. CoAP, instead, is a RESTful protocol at the
Application Layer, laying on top of the UDP transport pro-
tocol. It has been designed to be easily mapped into HTTP
via proxies, to support retransmissions, sleepy devices, and
resource discovery. The use of UDP makes it possible to
avoid the support of the rather sophisticated connection-control
mechanisms of TCP, but on the other hand requires to account
for out-of-order message delivery and loss packets.
At
the
PHY
and
MAC
layers,
networks
employing
6LowPAN and CoAP typically relay on protocols from the
IEEE 802.15.4 family. Instead, the routing within the IoT
network is usually based on the IPv6 routing protocol for low-
power and lossy networks (RPL), deﬁned in RFC 6550 [90].
RPL has been mainly designed for multipoint to point commu-
nications, such as those in wireless sensor networks. However,
it also supports point to multipoint (sink broadcast) and point-
to-point (leaf nodes communicating with each other). RPL
builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based on a root node
called Low power and lossy border router (LBR), usually
being the device responsible for the management of a group
of nodes and representing the border between two networks.
From the DAG, RPL creates a destination oriented direct
acyclic graph (DODAG) tree, exempliﬁed in Fig. 11. The
DODAG contains only one root and is loop free. Starting from
the DODAG root, devices broadcast their DODAG information
objective (DIO) message, which contains device and link met-
rics. The global repair and local repair mechanisms are used
in case of a broken link: the ﬁrst recalculates the whole topol-
ogy, while the second operates locally, by informing all the
children of a node that they need to update their parent.
Attack Surface: A hypothetical attacker can target the RPL
or operate at the adaptation layer, based on the level of control
over the network that it wants to achieve.
a) Attacks against RPL:
Many of the attacks on
6LoWPAN focus on redirecting trafﬁc and disrupting the rout-
ing tree. In the following we report some examples of such
attacks [91]–[93].
1) Clone ID and Sibyl Attacks: In the clone ID attack, the
malicious node clones the identity of another node. In
the sibyl attack, the attacker uses the identity of sev-
eral entities at the same time. In this way, the malicious
entity can access and redirect a large amount of network
Fig. 11.
DODAG tree built for 6LoWPAN routing.
trafﬁc. These types of attack can be detected by keeping
track of the number of instances of each identity or by
monitoring the geographical location of the devices.
2) Sinkhole Attack: This is the same type of attack
described for ZigBee: the malicious node declares to the
sink very efﬁcient routing paths toward the other nodes,
gaining control over a large part of the trafﬁc ﬂows.
3) Selective Forwarding and Black Hole Attacks: These
attacks take place when a node of the network, that
is supposed to forward the packets along the correct
routing path, discards some of the trafﬁc (selective for-
warding), or all the trafﬁc (black hole), that passes
through it. Possible solutions may be the creation of
disjoint or dynamic paths inside the DAG.
4) Hello Flooding Attack: The Hello message is used by
a node in a 6LoWPAN network to announce its pres-
ence. If a node receives a Hello message, it assumes
that the sender node is in its neighborhood, and can
thus be directly reachable. An attacker can exploit this
mechanism by broadcasting Hello messages using a
transmission power larger than that permitted. In this
way, a substantial number of nodes consider the attacker
as a neighbor. However, when one of them tries to use
the new link, the sent packets will be lost, since the
legacy transmit power level is not sufﬁcient to guarantee
good communication. This type of attack can be avoided
using link layer acknowledgments to check the message
reception.
Contrary to the previous ones, the following attacks relies
on the exploitation of the RPL service messages [91]–[93].
1) Local Repair Attack: The malicious node continu-
ously sends local repair messages. This forces repeated
updates of the network topology, even if there is no
connectivity problem. These operations are costly both
in terms of computational resources and energy, caus-
ing service degradation and early energy depletion for
battery operated devices.

2) Version Number Attack: The version number is a ﬁeld
of DIO messages that is incremented at each rebuild-
ing of the DODAG. The malicious transmission of DIO
messages with a higher version number may force the
whole DODAG to be unnecessarily rebuilt. Again, this
causes service degradation and energy depletion.
b) Attacks from the Internet side: Neither 6LoWPAN
nor CoAP provide secrecy, authentication, or integrity pro-
tection. Therefore, the use of 6LoWPAN and CoAP without
additional security measures makes the devices fully accessi-
ble from the Internet. A proposal has been made to extend
CoAP in order to provide built-in security, but it has not yet
been included in the standard [94]. The CoAP speciﬁcations,
instead, suggest the use of datagram TLS (DTLS) to pro-
vide secrecy, authentication, and integrity protection [35], [95].
Alternatively, IPsec [96] can be used to provide authentication
and encryption at the IP level.
If no encryption and authentication mechanisms are used, an
attacker could easily gain access to the IoT network and eaves-
drop sensitive information from the data ﬂow. Additionally,
the attacker may gain the control of the sensor nodes, e.g., to
create a bot-net [97]. As an example, Hernandez et al. [98]
presented a modiﬁcation of the Nest thermostat ﬁrmware to
use it as part of a bot-net. The bot-nets may then be used to
launch DoS attacks to other targets. This kind of attack can be
detected through an analysis of the node trafﬁc: in fact, nodes
in a bot-net usually transmit more data than clean devices, in
order to maintain the bot-net.
c) Attacks at the adaptation layer:
The forwarding
of packets between the public Internet and the 6LoWPAN
network is implemented at the border router. The lack of
authentication and the limited computational resources of the
devices that perform the adaptation make this mechanism
vulnerable to attacks. Two attacks that can be performed at
this level, fragment duplication and buffer reservation, are
presented in [99]. The fragment duplication attack relies on
the fact that a node cannot verify at the 6LoWPAN layer
if a received fragment belongs to the same IPv6 packet
of the previous ones, since this control is performed at
higher layers. If a malicious node injects fragments with
the same header of the legitimate 6LoWPAN packet, the
target node cannot distinguish between them and the legit-
imate ones. Therefore, it cannot decide which fragments
have to be used during packet reassembly procedure. This
causes the reconstruction of a corrupted IPv6 packet, which is
consequently dropped.
The buffer reservation attack leverages the limited memory
of the network nodes. In the 6LoWPAN network, receiving
nodes must reserve buffer space to reassemble the fragments
that belong to the same IPv6 packet. When the reassembly
buffer is assigned to one IPv6 packet, received fragments of
other IPv6 packets are dropped. Since buffer space reservation
is kept for 60 s, if an arbitrary fragment is transmitted by
the attacker to the target node, the latter will not be able to
receive further fragmented packets in the following minute.
Consecutive repetitions of this attack cause a long term DoS
to the targeted device, while employing just a small amount
of the malicious node resources.
Fig. 12.
Protocol stacks of LoRaWAN end-devices, gateway, and network
server. The document in [100] provides the speciﬁcations for LoRaWAN.
In order to protect 6LoWPAN networks from the attack-
ers, intrusion detection systems speciﬁcally tailored to IoT
networks have been studied [91]–[93]. An intrusion detec-
tion system monitors the network parameters and can identify
signs of intrusions or attacks. Intrusion detection systems for
6LoWPAN networks are optimized to save the largest amount
of network resources. Due to the vast attack surface, intru-
sion detection systems should operate both at the adaptation,
RPL, and Application Layers. Therefore, a hybrid architec-
ture is needed, in which a centralized module, installed on the
border router, cooperate with distributed modules installed on
internal nodes.
D. LoRaWAN
Description: LoRaWAN, introduced in 2015 by the LoRa
Alliance [100], is a link layer protocol that sits on top of the
LoRa physical layer. The protocol stack is shown in Fig. 12. As
for the previous protocols, LoRaWAN is optimized for battery-
powered end-devices. LoRaWAN has a star-of-stars topology
that includes end-devices, gateways, and network server, as
exempliﬁed in Fig. 13.
In an LoRaWAN network, the end-devices communicate
via single-hop links to one or more gateways, which are
themselves connected to a single network server via legacy
IP technologies. LoRa communication uses channels in the
868/900 MHz ISM band. The data rate ranges from 0.3 Kb/s
to 50 Kb/s with a communication range of many kilometers.
The communication is bidirectional and is always initiated by
the end-device. After each uplink transmission, the end-device
opens two downlink windows in different sub-bands to receive
data from the network server. The protocol used to access the
channel is ALOHA [101], [102].
LoRa end-devices can belong to three different classes,
namely A, B, and C, which are associated to different oper-
ation modes. The operation mode of class A, described above,
has to be implemented by all LoRaWAN devices. Class B and
C, instead, offers some additional features. Class B devices
can open extra receive windows at scheduled times to enable
the reception of unsolicited messages from the network server.
Class C devices, instead, are expected to be connected to the
power grid and, then, can keep the receive window always
open.
The commissioning procedure by which a device can join an
LoRaWAN network is named over the air activation (OTAA).
This procedure leverages on some information stored on the
device: the end-device identiﬁer (DevEUI), the application
identiﬁer (AppEUI), and the application key (AppKey). The

ﬁrst two are unique global identiﬁers for the end-device and
the application provider, respectively. Instead, the AppKey is
an AES-128 key assigned by the application owner and is spe-
ciﬁc to the end-device. The uniqueness of the key is needed
to ensure security: if the key is shared between devices, trafﬁc
eavesdropping becomes possible. The join procedure is initi-
ated by the end-device by sending a join request, including
the DevEUI and AppEUI. If the device is allowed to join the
network, the network server replies with a join accept mes-
sage. The message includes the network identiﬁer (NetID),
the application nonce (AppNonce), and the end-device address
(DevAddr). The NetID and DevAddr are 32 bits long: the ﬁrst
uniquely identiﬁes the network, while the second identiﬁes
the end-device within the network. The AppNonce is used by
the end-device to derive the network session key (NwkSKey)
and the application session key (AppSKey), which are spe-
ciﬁc for each end-device. The latter and the network server
use the session keys to encrypt and decrypt the payload of
the messages. Speciﬁcally, NwkSKey is used for MAC com-
mands, while AppSKey is employed for application speciﬁc
messages. These keys are also used to verify the MIC, to guar-
antee data integrity. In fact, the MIC is a 4 bytes tag, obtained
by encrypting the message with NwkSKey using AES-128.
Once the end-device has joined the LoRaWAN network,
all future messages are encrypted using a combination of
NwkSKey and AppSKey. The payload encryption is performed
using AES-128, and is based on the following procedure. First,
a number of 16-byte information blocks {Ai}, are created. Each
block contains the DevAddr, two frame counters, and a byte
indicating the stream direction. Each block Ai is then encrypted
to obtain the corresponding Si block using the NwkSkey, if
the payload to be encrypted consists only in MAC manage-
ment commands, and the AppSKey otherwise. The payload is
ﬁnally encrypted by the XOR operation between the message
itself and the sequence of blocks Si [100].
Attack Surface: The ﬁrst weakness of the LoRaWAN pro-
tocol is related to key management [103]. AppKey, NwkSKey,
and AppSKey are all stored in the end-devices. Therefore,
using a side channel analysis attack it can be possible to
recover the keys exploiting the variations in power consump-
tion or electromagnetic emissions from the transceiver during
the encryption. This is eased by the fact that LoRaWAN
devices are expected to work in an unattended fashion and
in remote locations, and hence surreptitious physical access to
the device is possible. NwkSKeys and AppSKeys are stored
also in the network server that generated them. Violation of
the network server by other means, e.g., by attacking a nonse-
cure service running on the same computer, may give access
to the LoRaWAN network and applications.
Furthermore, because of the way the protocol is designed,
nodes must share the same NwkSKey and AppSKey if they
need to support multicast messages. In this case, discover-
ing the keys from just one node will give access to all the
other communications. To overcome this problem, the nodes
need to be able to differentiate between multicast and unicast
communications. In the ﬁrst case, they should use the com-
mon key, while the unique NwkSKeys and AppSKeys should
be preferred for unicast communications. In this way, if the
attacker corrupts the multicast key, only multicast messages
would be insecure.
An attacker may also focus on the link between the gate-
way and the network server. Even if, in principle, any legacy
IP protocol can be used for such a connection, in practice
many deployments relay on the protocol provided by Semtech,
which is based on plain unprotected UDP. Therefore, while the
LoRaWAN packets payload is encrypted, still it is possible to
disrupt the network services by forging or modifying network
management packets.
Class B networks introduce additional threats because of
beacons and multicast messages [103]. Beacon messages are
not encrypted: they represent a source of information about
the network and provide a way to inject malicious data into
it. In fact, beacons can also be generated by an attacker, and,
since a node cannot distinguish between malicious and gen-
uine beacon messages, the network operations could be easily
disrupted.
V. EXAMPLES OF IMPLEMENTATIONS IN
COMMERCIAL DEVICES
In general, IoT devices include at least two microcontrollers:
one responsible for the management and processing of the data
and the other for connectivity. In the following of this section
we investigate the characteristics of the processors in charge
of the connectivity aspects, with a particular focus on their
security features.
Most of the considered devices use ARM microcontrollers
of the Cortex-M series. Especially, the M0, M0+, and M23
microcontrollers are designed for applications that require
minimal costs, power, and size. Because of these character-
istics, they are the most adopted in embedded applications.
Instead, the M3 and M4 models offer a balance between
performance and energy efﬁciency. Lastly, the M7 is the most
powerful controller, designed for high performance embedded
applications [104]. Fig. 14 reports the relative performance of
different Cortex-M designs with respect to the Cortex M0.
Differently from the more powerful Cortex-A and Cortex-
R processors, the Cortex-M series is provided only with a
Memory Protection Unit, which is a trimmed down version
of the Memory Management Unit: it only provides memory
protection, instead of providing full virtual memory manage-
ment. Also, the Cortex-M microcontrollers are equipped with

less RAM and ﬂash memory with respect to microcontrollers
from the other two classes [42].
Microcontrollers from the Cortex-M family do not inte-
grate any hardware pseudorandom number generator, nor any
module supporting cryptographic algorithms such as AES.
Therefore, support for cryptographic algorithms is imple-
mented via software or by dedicated co-processors, which is
the most common solution in commercial devices.
For
what
concerns
software
cryptographic
routines,
performance could wildly vary between different microcon-
trollers, even within the same family. In this regard, Tschofenig
and Pegourie-Gonnard from ARM have collected performance
ﬁgures of different cryptographic algorithms implemented in
software in the M0/M0+ and M3/M4 microprocessors [42],
[106]. The algorithms taken into account are ECC, SHA, and
AES. Tests were performed on two different development
boards: the NXP LPC1768 and the Freescale FRDM-KL25Z.
The former embeds an ARM Cortex-M3 CPU at 96 MHz,
512 KB ﬂash memory and 32 KB RAM. The latter is con-
trolled by an ARM Cortex-M0+ CPU at 48 MHz, 128 KB
ﬂash memory and 16 KB RAM.1 The authors exploit dif-
ferent NIST secp*r1 elliptic curves used in cryptography and
show performance results using different optimization settings.
Fig. 15 reports the results for the two development boards:
in particular, the performance of different phases of elliptic
curve cryptography algorithms are compared when using the
NIST secp256r1 curve. Both CPU speed and RAM usage
have a signiﬁcant impact on performance. Therefore, it is
crucial to reach the optimal tradeoff between RAM usage
and performance. Tschofenig and Pegourie-Gonnard state that,
usually, the increased performance is worth the additional
RAM usage.
A. ZigBee Implementations
As introduced in Section IV-A, different smart light systems
adopt the ZigBee protocol. The Philips HUE system is one
1The considered boards have no hardware pseudorandom number genera-
tor, which means that the low entropy of the generated numbers would not
be suitable for real world deployments. This, however, does not affect the
speed of the considered cryptographic functions, therefore the results are still
signiﬁcant.

of them and presents multiple hardware implementations
(Table I). Most of the light bulbs available on the market
embed the wireless module ATMEL SAMR21, which has
two components: 1) the ATMEL SAMD21 core (based on
the ARM Cortex M0+ architecture) and 2) the AT86RF233
radio transceiver, which supports both ZigBee and 6LoWPAN
protocols. The ARM Cortex M0+ microcontroller does not
implement any hardware cryptographic routine, since it lacks
a hardware pseudorandom number generator. To overcome this
problem, the AT86RF233 incorporates a two-bit random gen-
erator where the source of randomness is given by the noise
observations [107], [108]. The generated random number can
be used both for the creation of a random seed for the AES
key generation. In addition, a dedicated hardware module is
included to perform the AES-128 encryption procedure. To
use this module, a 128-bit nonmodiﬁable initial key needs to
be preinstalled in the device. The source of entropy is updated
every 1 µs. Other Philips HUE products (e.g., the Philips
Go) embed a different 8-bit microcontroller, the ATMEL
M2564RFR2, which still uses the just described mechanism
as the entropy source. The HUE Bridge, another product in
the Philips HUE line, embeds the Texas Instruments CC2530
microcontroller, which integrates an Intel 8051 microproces-
sor and a co-processor for AES encryption and decryption.
Pseudorandom numbers are generated using a 16-bit linear
feedback shift register, which can be seeded with random data
from the noise in the radio analog-to-digital-converter [109].
The Nest Protect smoke alarm and the Nest thermostat
also use ZigBee for communications. They adopt the EM357
system-on-a-chip (SoC) from Silicon Labs, which is based on
the 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 and includes an IEEE 802.15.4
radio transceiver [110]. The SoC is provided with additional
hardware to perform AES encryption: the AES CCM, CBC-
MAC, and CTR modes are implemented in hardware. The 16-
bit seed is generated from the analog circuitry thermal noise.
B. BLE Implementations
As mentioned in Section IV-B1, most of the considered ﬁt-
ness bands embed microprocessors from the ARM Cortex M

family. For what concerns the BLE connectivity module, as
shown in Table II, both the popular FitBit Flex 2 and FitBit
Charge HR use the nRF8001 by Nordic semiconductor for the
BLE connectivity [111]. The latter works together with the
Texas Instruments CC2540 microcontroller, which provides
an AES security co-processor for encryption and decryption
purposes [112]. A different design choice has been taken for
the newer FitBit Charge 2, which uses the BlueNRG SoC by
STMicroelectronics. This SoC includes an ARM Cortex M0
microcontroller, which embeds an AES security co-processor,
and a separate Bluetooth module [113].
The Nike+ Fuelband uses two different modules: the
CC2564B BLE radio interface and the 16-bit MSP430F5
MCU, both from Texas Instruments [114]. The ﬁrst of these
modules has a 128-bit hardware encryption accelerator that,
however, only supports the version 4.0 security features. The
more recent Nike+ Fuelband SE uses the Qualcomm Bluetooth
Smart IC CSR1010A, which has a dedicated module for
AES encryption, but is limited to the BLE 4.1 speciﬁcation
too [115].
C. Devices With 6LoWPAN Stack
The Lifx Color 1000 light bulb system implements the
6LoWPAN protocol, and uses the Texas Instruments SoC
CC2538 [116]. This SoC is based on the ARM Cortex M3 and
implements AES in hardware. For 6LoWPAN applications, the
ATMEL SAMR21, already discussed in Section V-A, can also
be used. Another solution with AES hardware implementation
is the LTC5800-IPM by Linear Technology, which is based on
the ARM Cortex M3 [117].
D. LoRa Devices
LoRa development boards use the STM32L052T8Y6 MCU
coupled with the Semtech SX1272 radio transceiver [118]. The
MCU is based on a Cortex M0+ microprocessor. Differently
from the previous protocols, not many consumer-level IoT
products that implement LoRaWAN are available. In fact,
LoRaWAN is more commonly used in sensor networks to col-
lect data from large areas: the products using this protocol are
heavily customized for each application.
VI. FINAL REMARKS
Given the widespread adoption of IoT solutions for sensor
networks, domotics, and health application, providing secure
communications in IoT networks is of paramount importance.
In this scenario, the end user is often unaware of the secu-
rity issues related to the devices which are part of her/his
everyday life. For example, without protections against eaves-
dropping, IoT wireless networks can expose sensitive personal
information. Also, without authentication, malicious attack-
ers can masquerade as legitimate devices and disrupt IoT
network operations. In addition to the issues related to the
protocol and network security design, the reduced computa-
tional capabilities and the need for low energy consumption
limit the cryptographic functionalities that can be installed in
IoT devices.
As we have discussed in this article, in ZigBee and BLE
implementations, ease-of-use is favored over strong security.
This is because of the supposedly noncritical applications
they usually support, underestimating the risk that such tech-
nologies can be exploited to enter more critical systems, for
example when a dual-stack device is attached to both a critical
and noncritical system.
6LoWPAN and LoRaWAN adopt two complementary secu-
rity strategies. Since LoRaWAN can be used, for very simple
applications, without any transport and application layers, the
protocol has been designed with strong security in mind and
mandatory packet encryption and authentication. The design-
ers of 6LoWPAN and CoAP, instead, decided to delegate the
security aspects to other layers and hardened only the aspects
strictly connected to the protocol operation (e.g., routing and
fragmentation). This allows, for example, the use of CoAP
over LoRaWAN, without incurring in the cost for encryption
and key exchanges at multiple levels.
Additional security extensions to existing standards have
been proposed in the literature, but they have not been adopted
by standardization entities and in commercial devices yet. For
example, [72] proposes CryptoCoP, an encryption protocol
for resource-constrained devices that supports energy-efﬁcient
symmetric key cryptography for BLE. Bonetto et al. [119]
proposed another interesting solution to decentralize compu-
tationally intensive tasks of devices to a trusted and uncon-
strained node of the network; this node is then responsible
for the calculation of the master session key on behalf of a
group of constrained IoT devices. Zhou and Piramuthu [120]
investigated some issues with security improvement proposals
found in the literature for IoT devices, particularly for the
Fitbit ﬁtness trackers. In [121], an algorithm for IoT con-
nection establishment and key exchange, between node and
mediator, based on timestamps is proposed. The time-based
secure key generation approach aims at efﬁciently managing
and renewing the keys to provide a trustful connection, while
guaranteeing the integrity of data transmitted over an insecure
channel. Timestamps and nonces are also used to avoid attacks

VII. OPEN CHALLENGES
Despite the many mechanisms proposed by security experts,
the ﬁeld of IoT cybersecurity still offers a number of open
research challenges. In Table III is reported the security mech-
anisms that the different technologies implement to fulﬁll the
requirements speciﬁed by the security goals at the information,
access and functional levels. In the same table, the vulnerabil-
ities that have been identiﬁed in the literature are summarized.
These vulnerabilities allow a malicious entity to attack the IoT

devices and threat the security goals. In Table IV, the attacks
described in this article are grouped into ﬁve relevant classes
and, for each of them, the technologies vulnerable to attacks
of that type are highlighted. A blank cell means that, to the
best of our knowledge, there are not works in the literature
that study the vulnerability of that technology to that speciﬁc
class of attacks.
From the table we can see that both ZigBee and 6LoWPAN
suffer from attacks against the network communication proto-
cols, as the routing information in the packets are not usually
authenticated. Similarly, they are subject to energy or resource
depletion attacks that force the nodes to process a large number
of forged packets. Full header and control packets authenti-
cation would block many of such attacks and improve the
functional level robustness of the network. The deployment
of such comprehensive authentication procedures, however, is
hindered by two factors. The ﬁrst is linked to the lack of a
widely accepted lightweight encryption algorithm that could
be implemented in hardware, or be supported by the most
common cryptographic libraries for embedded devices. The
second relates to the supplementary information to be added
to the packets for this additional authentication requirement,
which would increase the already signiﬁcant overhead incurred
for short payload messages. Therefore, there is a need for
strong authentication mechanisms that use a small amount of
additional space in the packet, or for mechanisms using alter-
native types of information, e.g., acquired from the physical
layers. Physical layer authentication is a possible solution, but
its maturity level is still insufﬁcient for its implementation in
commercial products.
A second open challenge is related to the management of
shared cryptographic keys, which is a common weakness of
the different protocols (see Table IV). As mentioned in the
protocol analysis, commissioning and conﬁguration procedure
often require a shared key among all the nodes in the network.
The management of such a key, however, is a complex task,
since a key update requires its secure and timely distribu-
tion over the whole network. Moreover, additional overhead is
required to guarantee the consistency of the shared key among
the devices. Since a shared key is more likely to be discov-
ered by attackers, key rotation should happen quite frequently,
further exacerbating the problems. To avoid such complex-
ity in shared key management, a mechanism is needed to
allow devices to create and update shared keys independently,
for example by using information available to all devices but
unknown to attackers.
As we have seen, the physical implementation of a given
technology is as important as its theoretical design. For
example, the use of microcontrollers with poor quality entropy
sources may allow an attacker to extract the key used in the
cryptographic routines. Also, devices that do not randomize
identiﬁers transmitted in clear, like MAC addresses, can be
exploited to attack the users’ privacy.
The European Union Agency for Network and Information
Security, in [123], evaluates good practices to secure the life-
cycle of IoT products and servers, looking at all the security
aspects in this scenario. Security measurements are categorized
into the three phases of IoT devices life-cycle: starting from
the development of the products to their usage, passing through
their integration in smart networks.
While the amount of issues reviewed in this article is con-
sistent, we believe that a more careful design of the devices
and the networks will make IoT systems really secure and will
enable their use also for critical applications.
