[How We Review](https://www.safehome.org/editorial-guidelines/)
Ring remains a dominant force in the security camera industry. They are consistently innovating long after they pioneered video doorbells that transformed how we monitor our homes. After testing four of their security cameras, here’s a quick overview of the standout features:
  * All Ring security cameras deliver at least 1080p HD resolution, color night vision, customizable motion alerts, and enhanced two-way audio.
  * Ring cameras store videos in the cloud for 180 days starting at $4.99 per month per camera.
  * [Ring’s pricing](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/) for unlimited cloud recording and Ring Alarm professional monitoring starts at $19.99 per month.


We know you need more details than that to find out if Ring’s home security cameras are right for you. There’s no doubt in our mind that they’re one of the [best home security camera brands](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/best/). But that doesn’t mean they’re right for everyone. So, let’s dig through our [experience with Ring’s Floodlight Cam](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/floodlight-cam/), Indoor Cam, Outdoor Cam, and Spotlight Cam so you can see if they’re right for you.
**Did You Know?** Ring cameras offer solid performance at affordable prices, but you might prefer more advanced alternatives. For instance, Google Nest Cams offer facial recognition that can distinguish between familiar faces and strangers. Check out our list of the [best home security systems](https://safehome.org/security-systems/best/) to explore more options from top brands.
![Boxed Up Ring Security Cameras](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20704%20499'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Boxed Up Ring Security Cameras
##### PROS
  * Easy DIY installation with minimal wiring
  * 1080p HD video; up to 4K on newer models
  * Designed for indoor and outdoor use
  * Choose how you want to power your cameras (battery, wired, plugged in, solar)
  * Enhanced audio for clearer two-way talk
  * Built-in motion-activated lights on some models


##### CONS
  * No 4K indoor camera options
  * Premium models cost over $250 per camera
  * Past privacy concerns (though Ring has since added end-to-end encryption)
  * Design aesthetics could be improved


## Installing Ring Cameras
![Ring Stick Up Cam](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20335'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Stick Up Cam
Our first impressions of Ring equipment right out of the box? These aren’t the sleekest cameras on the market, but they’re far from the clunkiest. And allowing us to pick a color helped them match our home’s style. Most are available in black or white with a few also available in bronze and graphite.
Even more important to us than style is how easy it is to install home security equipment. We had no problems with Ring on that score. The company made its name by offering DIY-installed systems, and it knows what it’s doing. Everything went smoothly. Note that smoothly isn’t the same as quickly. It took us a full 30 minutes, for instance, to install our hardwired floodlight camera.
Hardwired requires turning a few screws and figuring out which wires go where. Always shut off your electricity first, or you might get zapped. It happened to us once years ago and we haven’t made that mistake since. Then, take the time to position your outdoor camera to maximize its coverage otherwise you might need two cameras to cover an area that should only need one.
And, we can report that Ring’s simpler cameras were simpler to set up. In fact, all three of the other models took us fifteen minutes, total.
The Ring Outdoor Cam (pictured above), for instance, was ready to go right out of the box. Since we opted for the battery-powered version, we didn’t need to place it near an outlet either. You also have choices when it comes to placement – hang the camera on a wall or simply place it on a flat surface.
Ring offers several versions of their Outdoor Cam, including battery-powered models, solar models, a plug-in version with Pan-Tilt functionality, and the Outdoor Cam Elite. The Elite model connects directly to your router for power and an internet connection, making it exceptionally reliable.

![Ring Stick Up Cam \(left\) compared to Ring Indoor \(right\)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20446'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Outdoor Cam (left) compared to Ring Indoor (right)
**Did You Know?** PoE stands for Power over Ethernet. With PoE devices, one cord connects to the internet and provides power.
Ring’s indoor camera is almost identical to the Outdoor Cam, as you’ll see in the image above, with two notable exceptions: The Indoor Cam is smaller and requires a power cord so it’s not as resistant to the elements.
The power cord is pretty short at only 6.5 feet. That limits how far away you can place the camera from a power outlet – without an extension cord, anyway.
![Ring Floodlight](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20744%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Floodlight
Those are the only drawbacks we ran into installing Ring cams; otherwise, you’re going to get the same easy setup and installation as many wireless security cameras available today.
Beyond installation, let’s explore the ins and outs of each camera in Ring’s suite, starting with the Outdoor Cam.
![Ring Spotlight](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20462'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

## Living With the Outdoor Cam
![Ring Stick Up Cam](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20471'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Outdoor Cam
Ring doesn’t have the feature set of [Google Nest Cams](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/nest-camera/reviews/), but their cameras are reliable across the board. Ring’s focus on dependability over bells and whistles has earned them a solid reputation. One excellent example is the [Ring Outdoor Cam we reviewed](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/stick-up-cam/).
In our testing, the Outdoor Cam delivers consistent performance in any weather. While Ring doesn’t publish an official IP rating, our unit handled both sunny days and heavy rain without issue. It also worked indoors just as well as it did outdoors. It may lack advanced features like vehicle detection (something we saw from the Arlo Pro 5S), but the Outdoor Cam also costs about $80 less than the average outdoor camera price.
You can count on it to detect movement, provide you with real-time alerts, and give you access to live audio and video feeds any time you want. It can record footage when it detects movement if you opt for one of Ring’s cloud storage plans, too. In short, it has all the core features you could want in a home security camera.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20394'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Outdoor Cam live view
### Freedom of Movement
This camera can work either as a battery-operated device or a plug-in device. That gave us enormous flexibility when it came to positioning this camera. You always want to take time to get the best vantage point, and if your power options are limited, that can limit your mounting choices.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20324'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Indoor Cam Night View
### Weather Resistant
As the name implies, Ring’s Outdoor Cam is weather resistant. That’s one of the key upgrades they made when they rebranded it from the Stick Up Cam. While it doesn’t have an official IP rating — which measures dust and water resistance — ours survived outdoors through several rainstorms and temperature fluctuations.1
### Narrow Field of Vision
The Outdoor Cam comes in several versions, but we’d suggest staying away from the standard version if you have a big area to monitor. That’s because it only offers 110-degree horizontal coverage. Put it in a corner like we did and it can watch over your entire porch, but 110 degrees is not enough to cover an entire yard.
Instead of the standard version, we recommend the Plus version. It has a 143-degree horizontal and 90-degree vertical viewing angle. That’s roughly 30 percent more coverage than the standard Outdoor Cam.
**Pro Tip:** [Reolink cameras](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/reolink/) don’t have the cache of a Ring cam, but they’re actually really impressive devices in and of themselves. Learn more about the brand in our full [Reolink camera review](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/reolink/reviews/). If you’re looking for an outdoor cam with pan-and-tilt technology, check out our latest Reolink E1 camera review.
### Smart Home Integration With Alexa
![Ring dashboard on the Alexa Show](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20422'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring dashboard on the Alexa Show
Ring’s deep integration with Amazon’s ecosystem goes beyond basic compatibility. We’ve been able to create sophisticated automations that trigger multiple devices based on camera events. As a member of the Amazon family, Ring performs smoothly with the Echo. The Ring app even includes an Alexa tab for easy setup (check out our [Ring home automation](https://www.safehome.org/doorbell-cameras/ring/automation/) page for the details).
Once you’ve done that, you have access to a full range of voice commands, like “Alexa, arm my driveway cam.” Plus, the Stick Up is versatile enough to work with the Google Home ecosystem as well.

## Testing the Ring Indoor Cam
![Ring Indoor Camera](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20408'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Indoor Camera
We also lived with the Indoor Cam. At less than three inches tall without its stand, it’s the smallest Ring camera. It’s easy to install since it practically fits anywhere, but it’s still packed with features. It has a 1080p resolution, customizable motion detection, and a manual privacy cover – a feature we highly recommend for indoor cameras.
**FYI:** Interested in a Ring Indoor Cam? Learn how it measures up against other popular options in our full [Ring Indoor Cam experience](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/indoor-cam/).
### Video Performance and Clarity
When it comes to streaming videos from the Ring Indoor Cam, we experienced delays of about two to five seconds. That’s normal for Wi-Fi cameras – even more expensive ones from Vivint and Google Nest. That said, the Ring Indoor Cam delivers an industry standard 1080p HD resolution. In our observation, the videos (especially recordings) also pop with color. They’re not cinematic – nor do we expect them to be – but the videos are clear and detailed.
![Ring Indoor Cam Video Quality](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20370'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Indoor Cam Video Quality
1080p HD has long been our gold standard. Sure. Both Lorex and Vivint offer 2K and 4K models. However, higher-resolution cameras are also subject to the whims of Wi-Fi signals. They require more bandwidth, which can lead to more severe streaming issues. All in all, we’re happy with the Indoor Cam’s decent image quality.
### Short Power Cord
We found the 6.5 foot power cord that comes with the Ring Indoor restrictive. It meant we either needed to get creative with our camera placement or run an extension cable over to the camera. Definitely not a dealbreaker for us, but you’ll want to make sure you plan to either use the camera near an outlet or are ready to buy an extension cable to go with your camera.
### A Quick Note on Cost
The word “cheap” has negative connotations. When you buy a product that doesn’t work right, you might call it “cheap.”
At $49.99, the Ring Indoor Cam is the most affordable camera in Ring’s lineup. You’re still getting industry-standard 1080p video quality and access to Ring’s powerful cloud-based network. Don’t expect premium features like 4K video quality or facial recognition, but for the price, it’s hard to beat.
For context, let’s take a look at the Ring Indoor Cam’s price against some of its leading competitors.
### Indoor Camera Pricing Lineup
Indoor Camera Model | Manufacturer | Price  
---|---|---  
E1 Pro | Reolink | $57.99  
Indoor Cam | Ring | $49.99  
Indoor Wi-Fi Security Camera | Lorex | $59.99  
Essential Indoor Camera | Arlo | $39.99  
Wireless Indoor Camera | SimpliSafe | $149.99  
Indoor Cam | Nest | $99.99  
**Did You Know?** If you’re really into the slim and simple theme, check out Blink, another Amazon brand similar to Ring. They won’t blow you away with features, but in our [tests of the Blink camera system](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/blink/reviews/), the cameras looked nice and installed in a snap.
## Ring Spotlight Cam Features and Performance
![Ring Spotlight Camera at Night](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20761%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Spotlight Camera at Night
The Spotlight Cam combines security lighting with surveillance capabilities. It features dual LED spotlights that could illuminate a radius of about 30 feet in our tests. The light activates every time the camera detects movement. We found it bright enough to deter intruders while providing clear visibility at night.
**FYI:** Looking to shed some light on would-be burglars and thieves? Read more about our full [Ring Spotlight Cam experience here](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/spotlight-cam/). We also talk about the different models of the Spotlight Cam, including Spotlight Cam Plus and Pro.
It’s still built like Ring’s other cameras with 1080p HD resolution, advanced motion detection, and two-way audio. We found the spotlight particularly handy to see what was going on at night on our property. For instance, we thought the neighbor’s dog was getting into our trash, but it turned out to be a couple of raccoons. After we signed up for Ring’s Neighbors app, we found out those raccoons were causing issues for others, too.
### Using the Spotlight Cam at Night
![Ring Spotlight Night View](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20368'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Spotlight Night View
The Spotlight Cam provides great nighttime images, so long as the spotlight itself is on. We were able to see well beyond our front porch. Without the spotlight activated, the camera relied on infrared night vision that provided clear black-and-white footage up to 30 feet away. Thankfully, we didn’t need to worry about the light bothering our neighbors. Unlike the Ring Floodlight, the Spotlight only illuminates the area directly in front of it.
**Pro Tip:** If you’re not a Ring loyalist, the Reolink Argus 3 Pro makes a solid Spotlight Cam alternative that’s a bit easier on the pocketbook. Visit our review of [Reolink Argus 3 Pro](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/reolink/argus-3/) to learn more.
### Adjusting Motion Settings
Ring’s motion detection algorithms have improved significantly during our last test. It reduced false alerts by up to 40 percent compared to earlier models we tested. We still recommend fine-tuning the motion settings of your Spotlight Cam. Depending on its positioning, the device’s motion detection will alert you to every passing pedestrian and car. You can eliminate these false alarms by drawing privacy zones over active areas outside of your property.
![Ring Motion Activation](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20390'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Motion Activation
You can also adjust the camera’s sensitivity. There’s a slider in the Ring app that makes this easy. We were able to eliminate most unwanted alerts with the sensitivity setting and privacy zones. But, sometimes you want to know about the traffic passing by your house. That’s why Ring lets you turn these settings off with ease or even put them on a schedule.
![Ring Motion Sensitivity Slider](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20299%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The Spotlight Cam Plus costs $149.99 for the battery-powered, plug-in, or solar models. However, the solar panel itself costs an additional $59.99. The wired version also costs more at $179.99. There’s also a Pro version of the Spotlight Cam that starts at $199.99. It adds HDR video, 3D motion detection, and Bird’s Eye View zones for more precise motion alerts. Recently, they added a new Pro model with 4K resolution for $249.99 as well.
**FYI:** The Ring Spotlight camera tends to go on sale from time to time. Check out our full [Ring camera deals and discounts guide](https://www.safehome.org/doorbell-cameras/ring/deals/) for more ways to save on Ring devices.
## The Floodlight Cam Experience
![Ring Floodlight Cam](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20525'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Floodlight Cam
Nestled firmly between two super-powerful LEDs, the Ring Floodlight Camera was the almost-perfect fixture to complement my outdoor decor. Ring also offers this model in a variety of finishes, including graphite and bronze, if you’re looking to get away from the more standard black or white design.
**Did You Know?** Bright LED lights can serve as an effective crime deterrent. With this in mind, read about Ring’s most robust camera/light combo in our latest [Ring Floodlight Cam review](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/floodlight-cam/).
It’s important to note that Ring is not the only company to make a floodlight camera. The Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Camera became a solid contender when it launched, featuring wire-free installation, while Ring’s floodlight camera requires hardwiring.
For our home, however, Ring’s hardwired setup worked best. It was the perfect opportunity to replace an old light fixture that was a little past its prime, with a shiny new floodlight-camera-in-one.
![Installing the Ring Floodlight Cam](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20423'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Installing the Ring Floodlight Cam
After spending about an hour hardwiring the Ring Floodlight Cam, we quickly realized it was time well spent. We got unprecedented night vision range, a wide field-of-view, and two-way audio. However, the light itself is what made it really stand out. It’s so bright it could scare the daylights out of even an experienced burglar.
![A family of deer travels across our property.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20452'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Floodlight Cam Video Quality
There are a few more things you should know about this camera before making your final decision, though, starting with that previously mentioned audio feature:
### Two-Way Talk
When it comes to audio on the Floodlight Cam, all was well with the exception of some interference due to background noise, usually on the outdoor end of the conversation.
It’s not the first time we’ve encountered this issue. Ambient noise — the kind that happens outside that you can’t control or predict — can make communication difficult at times. But frankly, the issue is minor, and it shouldn’t affect the overall performance.
### Durable Hardware
![Ring Floodlight Cam Box](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20525'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring Floodlight Cam Box
Ring’s Floodlight Cam is durable and protected from the elements. Good thing, too. While we were testing it, we had one of those late-winter snowstorms that Midwesterners like to call “second winter.” No problem. The Floodlight Cam performed seamlessly even in high winds and frigid temperatures. No damage.
### Using the Camera With Ring App
![Ring App Homescreen](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20231%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Ring App Homescreen
The best way to get acquainted with any wireless camera is to learn everything it can do through the mobile app. With Ring, you know that’s going to be easy – and it will also help you prepare for the unexpected.
Occasionally, you might find a few rare instances of delay between the time the camera captures motion and the time you receive an alert. Again, that is standard in cameras that work with Wi-Fi, and a bit more common in outdoor cameras than indoor ones. But with a stable Wi-Fi connection, you should have no problem securing your home with a Ring Floodlight.

Ring Floodlight Cam Motion Detection
After successful sales of Ring’s first-generation Floodlight Cam, the brand now offers three models. There’s the Floodlight Cam Plus, Pro, and Pro (Current Gen). The Plus is the basic version with the Pro adding 2K resolution, 3D motion detection and Audio+ for improved two-way talk. It costs more at $229.99 compared to $179.99. For the latest Pro model, they brought the resolution up to 4K for $279.99.
Speaking of price, it’s worth mentioning that the Ring Floodlight Cam Plus is another one we’ve seen marked down frequently throughout the year. It regularly retails for $199.99 (you’ll see a bigger breakdown below), but it happens to be a very popular device to snag around Prime Day, too.
## Ranking Ring’s Cameras
After extensive testing of Ring’s expanded camera lineup in 2024, we’ve evaluated each model based on value, features, and real-world performance to help you choose the right camera for your specific needs. Here are our recommendations.

## Snapshot of Ring Equipment Pricing
“You get what you pay for.” You’ve surely heard that expression many times, especially if you’ve ever bought home security equipment before. Like buying a car, adding security cameras can be a very personal experience – so you want to get the product that’s right for you.
Luckily, Ring cameras are for the masses. They’re made for the everyday DIY user, and generally not recommended if you’re looking for wall-to-wall home security or 24/7 monitoring. For that, we’d go with a fully wired system like [Frontpoint Home Security](https://www.safehome.org/security-systems/frontpoint/), or even something from [SimpliSafe, a super-DIY setup](https://www.safehome.org/security-systems/simplisafe/).
For now, let’s break down how much you should expect to pay for each Ring camera. We also recommend checking out our comprehensive [Ring camera package and pricing page](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/) for more cost considerations.

**Pro Tip:** Ring’s cameras are almost always on sale. To figure out which cameras can give you the most value, you need to know Ring’s current sales. That’s why we put together a guide to the [best deals on Ring cameras](https://www.safehome.org/doorbell-cameras/ring/deals/) so you can figure out if now is the right time to buy the cameras you need.
## Ring Video Storage
Ring lets you self-monitor your cameras if you want, and that’s entirely free. You still get real-time alerts and access to live footage through Ring’s app. That’s perfect if you’re on a tight budget. If you want to record and review footage, Ring Home Basic costs $4.99 monthly for one camera or doorbell. The Standard plan at $9.99 monthly covers unlimited devices at one location.
Ring’s Premium plan offers 180 days of event history (just like Basic and Standard), but also includes 14 days of continuous recording for select plugged in or wired cameras. It costs $19.99 per month, making it competitive with Google Home Premium Advanced (60 days event history + 10 days continuous recording).
#### Ring’s Subscription Model: A Breakdown
Ring Home Subscriptions | Free | Basic | Standard | Premium  
---|---|---|---|---  
Cameras Supported | Unlimited | One | Unlimited | Unlimited  
Instant Mobile Alerts | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes  
Live Video Streaming | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes  
180-Day Video History | No | Yes | Yes | Yes  
Notifications with Video Previews | No | Yes | Yes | Yes  
24/7 Recording | No | No | No | Yes  
Video Search and AI Descriptions | No | No | No | Yes  
Professional Monitoring for Ring Alarm | Not Available | Not Available | +$10 per month | +$10 per month  
Monthly Price | Free | $4.99 per month | $9.99 per month | $19.99 per month  
Yearly Price | Free | $49.99 per year | $99.99 per year | $199.99 per year  
Ring also offers a premium monitoring service similar to SimpliSafe’s Intruder Intervention. They call it their Virtual Security Guard service. It enables Ring’s monitoring agents to actively review your live video feeds during events and use your camera’s two-way talk to deter criminals. That service comes at a hefty price of $99 per month, which is more than SimpliSafe ($32.99 monthly) charges but less than Deep Sentinel (starts at $100 monthly).
## Ring Cameras: Final Thoughts
So let’s bottom line all of this. Ring makes great cameras. That should come as no surprise, given that the company’s [Ring Video Doorbell](https://www.safehome.org/doorbell-cameras/ring/reviews/) completely revolutionized the industry. Ring makes a wide range of devices, enough to suit virtually any home security need, and all of them can go toe-to-toe with the best offerings from companies like [Arlo](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/arlo/) and [Google Nest](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/nest-camera/). They’re reliable, they come with a range of features, and they’re all offered at an affordable price. Best of all, with monitoring options and a responsive app, they give you control over your home security.

## Ring Security Cam FAQs
  * [Is the Ring Floodlight Camera waterproof?](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/reviews/)
Gloomy Midwestern thunderstorms are no match for the Ring Floodlight. The camera is made to hold up in harsh weather like storms, wind, and rain.
  * [Do Ring cameras offer home automation?](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/reviews/)
Yes, with some exceptions. Ring cameras work seamlessly with Amazon Alexa for hands-free voice control and video streaming on Echo Show or Fire TV devices. They also have limited compatibility with Google Assistant and support for IFTTT automations.
  * [How much brighter is the Floodlight Cam than the Spotlight Cam?](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/reviews/)
The two LED floodlights on the Floodlight Camera put out 2,000 lumens each, while the Spotlight Cam’s LEDs are 375 lumens each. That makes Floodlight Cam over five times brighter than the Spotlight Cam.
  * [Is size the only difference between Indoor Cam and Stick Up Cam?](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/reviews/)
The Indoor Camera is not weather-resistant and is designed for indoor use only. The Outdoor Cam (formerly Stick Up Cam), on the other hand, is weather-resistant but not fully waterproof, so keep that in mind when positioning the camera outdoors.
  * [How is Ring’s customer service?](https://www.safehome.org/home-security-cameras/ring/reviews/)
A mixed bag, in my experience. You might not have the easiest time getting questions answered using Ring’s live chat, though it’s nice how easily accessible the chat feature is within their app. Other times, you’ll have better luck calling and speaking to a human.
