Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., along with our affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “**Samsung** ”) respects your concerns about privacy. This SmartThings Privacy Notice applies to the personal information we obtain through SmartThings (the “**Service** ”). It does not apply to information collected by other apps, websites or services provided by Samsung. If you are a minor, please refer to our SmartThings U.S. Privacy Notice for Minors with a parent or guardian, which will help you understand better what information we collect and how we use it.
This Privacy Notice supplements the Samsung Privacy Policy (available at https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy) (“**Samsung Privacy Policy** ”) and the Samsung Consumer Health Data Privacy Statement (available at https://www.samsung.com/us/privacy-policy/consumer-health-data-privacy-statement) (“**Consumer Health Data Privacy Statement** ”), and provides additional information about how we may collect, use and share your personal information in connection with the Service. In the event any portion of this Privacy Notice conflicts with the Samsung Privacy Policy and/or the Consumer Health Data Privacy Statement, the relevant provisions of this Privacy Notice will govern.

**Information We Obtain**
Through the Service, we may obtain information about you in various ways. The types of personal information we may obtain include:
_Information You Provide Directly_
·your interactions and inputs in relation to the Service (including configurations). This includes touch interactions (e.g. when you connect Samsung Family Hub and use its features), information you input (e.g. pet profile information in SmartThings Pet Care or information about your home), things you create (e.g. when you create maps in SmartThings Map View), routines you set up (including information such as text messages and contacts you send text messages to), and interests you select (e.g. dietary preferences in SmartThings Cooking or clothing in SmartThings Clothing Care).

For example, if you input your dietary preferences through SmartThings Cooking, your Family Hub will be updated to include those dietary preferences; 
·if you use voice commands to control SmartThings, information about your conversations, including voice commands, will be relayed through SmartThings servers to process your command. If you connect Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant to the Service, we may obtain audio content from your communications with Bixby (e.g.¸ voice commands);
·audio and visual content if you connect video or audio recording devices to the Service, including when you choose to share images and video clips, we may obtain content (and related information) that is captured and recorded by those devices, such as video or audio recordings, live video or audio streams, and images; and
·with your permission, health information when you use a feature that requires this information, such as sleep information (e.g., wake-up time and total sleeping time) when setting up routines or creating a sleep environment report.
Privacy and video surveillance laws in your jurisdiction may apply to your use of our products and services, including but not limited to video and audio recordings made by your Service-connected devices, as well as audio content obtained through Bixby. Please ensure that you comply with applicable law when you use our products or services. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home that you are using our products or services. Capturing, recording or sharing video or audio content that involves other people may affect their privacy rights.

If you use SmartThings Energy we also collect your Rewards point history to display to you;

·information about your devices, such as hardware and software information, configurations and settings, and device and other unique identifiers;
