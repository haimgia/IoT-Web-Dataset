Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) poses a major health concern in the United States by affecting over

5 million people accounting for at least 15% to 25% of strokes. It can be asymptomatic or subclinical with

its first presentation being stroke in 18%, and AF being only detected at the time of stroke. With evidence of

subclinical AF associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, recent developments indeed point towards

wearables, especially smart watches, being quite effective and representing a novel method for screening for

silent AF in the general population, and thereby reducing mortality and morbidity associated with it. This

manuscript aims to review whether the photoplethysmography (PPG) technology, employed in the wearables

to monitor heart rate, is accurate enough to aid in the diagnosis of AF that may remain asymptomatic or

paroxysmal. It also explores the option of actually employing this method in the general population, the

feasibility of this mode of diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity of this method compared to the conventional

electrocardiogram (EKG), and the actual follow up with a practitioner and subsequent treatment of AF, if

diagnosed. We conducted a Medline search using various combinations of “smart watch” “atrial fibrillation”

“wearables”, and “Kardia” to identify pivotal randomized trials published before June 1, 2019, for inclusion

in this review. Concurrently, major practice guidelines, trial bibliographies, and pertinent reviews were

examined to ensure inclusion of relevant trials. A consensus among the authors was used to choose items

for narrative inclusion. The following section reviews data from pivotal trials to determine the effectiveness

of smart watch technology in detecting AF in the general population. Trials reviewed evaluated apple

watch, Kardia, Samsung wearables in diagnosis of AF. The fact that there is an increase in consumer use of

wearables, smart devices, which can serve as health monitoring devices that can be used as a non-invasive,

ambulatory assessment of heart rate and rhythm, is definitely novel. Intermittent short EKG recordings

repeated over a longer-term period produced significantly better sensitivity for AF detection, with 4 times as

many cases diagnosed compared with a single time-point measurement. Since there are limitations and further

research into this new field is required, the wearable technology may not serve as the ultimate tool for diagnosis

of AF, rather a nidus for the general population to seek medical advice for confirmation on being notified of

having an irregular rhythm leading to prevention of morbidity and mortality associated with it.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) poses a major health concern in

the United States by affecting over 5 million people (1). It

is associated with significant mortality and morbidity by

increasing the risk of stroke 5-fold compared to general

population (2). In the United States, AF accounts for at

least 15% to 25% of strokes (3). It can be asymptomatic

or subclinical with its first presentation being stroke

in 18%, and AF being newly detected at the time of

stroke (4). Furthermore, the prevalence of AF increases

with age, being 65 or older places the prevalence around

4.4% with people who have previously undiagnosed AF

making 1.4% of it (5). Estimates of people in the United

States who may have previously unknown, asymptomatic

AF are around 700,000, with an estimated cost burden of

3.2 billion dollars (6,7).
With evidence of subclinical AF associated with increased

risk of ischemic stroke (8), previously only being detected

by ambulatory electrocardiogram (EKG) monitoring

either with temporary patches for short periods of time

or implantable recorders for longer periods, there might

be a place for wearable technology, which is typically used

on a regular basis, in aiding diagnosis of subclinical AF. As

the popularity of smart watches increases, with more than

325 million devices sold in 2016 alone (9) and 13% of the

US population owning smartwatches, with 40% of the

public showing interest in getting one (10), these devices

are becoming a commodity rapidly finding its way on

everyone’s wrist and in pockets. The use of these wearables

needs to be effective in diagnosing subclinical AF, with false

positives increasing health costs by unwarranted ER visits

or anxiety to the patient, or with false negatives missing the

diagnosis which may lead to morbidity or mortality.

Recent developments indeed point towards wearables,

especially smart watches, being quite effective and being

a novel method for screening for silent AF in the general

population. Though the technology is not only restricted

to smart watches, single lead EKGs that are portable and

phone applications that detect heart rate can serve as event

recorders during an episode of symptoms like palpitations,

but may be restricted by not providing continuous

monitoring.

Discussion
In this review, we will discuss the technology behind the

wearables and its efficacy. Further implementation of this

technology in different formats will also be addressed.

Photoplethysmography (PPG)
PPG is the measure of the volumetric change of the heart

by measuring light transmission or reflection. During

systole, the rise in pressure forces a forward pulse into the

blood vessel. The device shines light on the skin to detect

a pulse by measuring the difference in the quantity of light

reflected back to the sensor. The sensor is usually placed on

the skin in the areas where the artery is proximal to the skin.

Thus, the heart rate is measured using an algorithm. PPG

technology can be used in physical sensors, smart watches,

or even phone apps to measure heart rate.

PPG which is deemed as medical grade is accurate at

measuring heart rate in sinus rhythm (correlation coefficient

of 0.96) (11). However, PPG is limited by it underestimation

of heart rate during sinus tachycardia and accuracy suffers

during physical activity. On testing consumer grade PPG

technology (Apple watch, Fitbit, etc.), its accuracy was also

high in sinus rhythm (12). A small study analyzing PPG

data from smart watches with a deep neural network to

detect AF compared to a standard 12 lead EKG yielded

a sensitivity of 98.0% and specificity of 90.2% (13).

This proves the data obtained by PPG technology in the

wearables when analyzed by algorithms can be effective in

diagnosing AF.

Implementation of the PPG technology through

certain apps in phones can also be used to measure

heart rate. With 77% of the US population owning a

smartphone (14), this can be implemented as a measure to

detect irregular heart rate in general population. Cardiio

Rhythm app for I-phone implemented the phone’s camera

as a light sensor to obtain heart rate measurements.

An outpatient study involving 1,013 participants with

hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and/or aged ≥65 years,

revealed that the app was able to detect Atrial fibrillation

with a sensitivity of 92.9% (95% CI: 77–99%), specificity

of 97.7% (95% CI: 97–99%), with a positive predictive

value (PPV) of 53.1% (95% CI: 38–67%), and a negative

predictive value (NPV) of 99.8% (95% CI: 99–100%) (15).

Although this app cannot get continuous heart rate data

from the person, random heart rate checks can uncover

subclinical AF or even during symptoms palpitations act like

an event recorder to pick up an episode of AF.
Apple watch study
The Apple watch study was a prospective, single arm, open

label study with 419,297 participants conducted with a goal

of evaluating the ability of irregular pulse detection by the

Apple watch and subsequent irregular pulse notification

algorithm to identify AF (16). The primary endpoint was

AF >30 seconds on EKG patch and simultaneous AFib

on EKG patch and tachogram. The heart rate is recorded

as PPG waveforms by the Apple watch during periods of

minimal arm movement. Tachograms, which are heart rate

over a period of time, are created. If a tachogram detects

irregular heart rate, then the algorithm is triggered to get 4

confirmatory tachograms with irregular pulse rates during

minimal arm movements. After 4 confirmatory tachograms,

5 in total including the initial irregular tachogram, the

participant is alerted through a phone notification. The

notification encourages the participant to connect to a

Telehealth doctor, who based on the data from the Apple

watch readings and symptoms will advise the patient to

go to the ED if he deems the patient requires immediate

medical attention or will recommend an EKG patch that

will be shipped to the participant to be worn concurrently

with the watch for up to 7 days and returned at the end of

the study period for analysis.

The study population consisted of people aged ≥22 years

without history of AF or atrial flutter and current use of

anticoagulation. Of the study population, the mean age was

41 with the age group of 22 to 39 years old making 52% of

the study population. About 2,161 people got notified of

irregular heart rate and 658 of them ended up getting the

EKG patch with only 450 returned for analysis. Notification

rate was highest among the older population (≥65). AF was

detected in 34% of the cohort, who received a notification

and wore the EKG patch. This does not negate the fact

that more people may have been diagnosed with AFib with

longer EKG patch monitoring. Based on the analysis of

the PPG technology used in the Apple watch validated by

the concurrent use of the EKG patch, which is the current

standard for diagnosing paroxysmal arrhythmias, the PPV

of the tachograms was found to be 0.71 (95% CI: 0.69–0.74),

and the PPV of notifications, triggered by 5 tachograms,

was found to be 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76–0.92).

Although the study shows Apple watch might be a

viable initial diagnostic tool in subclinical AF, the majority

of the cohort was made up of young participants with the

study failing to reach the target enrollment of 75,000 aged

65 or older. The population was also relatively healthier

with 21% having hypertension, 5% having diabetes

mellitus. The study also relied on self-reporting of the

patients who are presented with the notification, though

the post study survey reveals that 57% of the study

population sought medical help outside of the Tele-health

system implemented in the study, of which 36% underwent

additional testing, with 33% being referred to a specialist

and 28% being started on a new medication. This can be a

sign that majority did indeed take the notification seriously

to get it further investigated by a physician.

Kardia Band (KB)
KB is a product made by AliveCor designed to be used as

an Apple Watch accessory. It mimics lead I and can record

a rhythm strip for 30 s. The KB application can then

use an algorithm to detect whether the strip shows atrial

fibrillation (AF) or not. Bumgarner et al. (17) conducted

a single center, prospective, nonrandomized, adjudicator-
blinded study with 100 participants to assess whether KB

algorithms could distinguish AF from sinus rhythm as well

as electrophysiologist-interpreted 12-lead EKGs can. The

three labels the KB algorithm can give a rhythm strip are

“possible AF” (based on rhythm irregularity and P-wave

absence), “normal” (no AF detected and heart rate is 50–100

beats/min), and “unclassified” (no AF detected and heart

rate is <50 or >100 beats/min or recording is either noisy or

>30 seconds, making up 34% of the recordings). The study

population consisted of people aged 18–90 years with a

history of AF who presented for a scheduled elective electrical

cardioversion. Of the study population, the mean age was

68; 169 simultaneous KB and EKG recordings were made of

each patient before and after cardioversion; 15 patients ended

up not undergoing cardioversion with 8 of them cancelling

due to being in sinus rhythm rather than AF.

Among the positive readings, the KB algorithm correctly

detected AF with 93% sensitivity (95% CI: 86–99%), 84%

specificity (95% CI: 73–95%), and k coefficient of 0.77

(95% CI: 0.65–0.89) when compared to electrophysiologist-
interpreted 12-lead EKG recordings. Electrophysiologists

who examined all 169 of the KB recordings (in total, they

could interpret 147; 22 of them were non-interpretable

due mainly to baseline artifact) correctly detected AF

with 99% sensitivity (95% CI: 96–100%), 83% specificity

(95% CI: 74–92%), and k coefficient of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74–
0.92) when compared to electrophysiologist-interpreted

12-lead EKG recordings. Thus, the study demonstrates that

he KB algorithm is pretty effective in detecting AF, with

increase in sensitivity when supported by physician review.
However, the authors note limitations of this study

such as the small sample size and patients all having

AF significant enough to be scheduled for electric

cardioversion. Generalizability may also be limited due to

participants being 17% female, socioeconomic status not

being examined, patients with implanted pacemakers or

defibrillators being excluded, and participants never having

used KB before. There could have been less unclassified

readings if participants had more practice with KB, but KB

performance may decrease outside these study settings as

the participants were taught how to use KB immediately

before each supervised recording. The study including

patients with already known AF limits it from commenting

about its efficiency in detecting subclinical AF.
Handheld EKG devices
Another way Smartphones can be used as EKG monitors is

by interfacing with peripherals such as a special smartphone

case with embedded electrodes to acquire, store, and

transfer single-channel EKG rhythms like AliveCor Heart

Monitor (AHM), which has already been US Food and

Drug Administration cleared and Conformite Europeenne

(CE) marked, and My Diagnostick handheld EKG stick.
The Chan et al. outpatient study also analyzed single-
lead EKG recorded by using the AliveCor heart monitor

with tracings reviewed subsequently by 2 cardiologists

to provide the reference standard in which Patients

with hypertension, with diabetes mellitus, and/or aged

≥65 years were recruited. The study found that The

diagnostic sensitivity of the AliveCor automated algorithm

71.4% (95% CI: 51–87%), the specificity 99.4% (95%

CI: 99–100%), the PPV 76.9% (95% CI: 56–91%), NPV

99.2% (95% CI: 98–100%) (15).

To determine the usability, accuracy, and cost-
effectiveness of two handheld single-EKG devices for AF

screening in a hospital population; a study was conducted in

which 445 hospitalized patients at cardiological or geriatric

wards were screened for AF by two handheld EKG devices

(My Diagnostick and AliveCor) (18). The performance of the

automated algorithm of each device was evaluated against a

full 12-leador 6-lead EKG recording. After the exclusion of

patients with an implanted device, sensitivity and specificity

of the automated algorithms were suboptimal (Cardiology:

81.8% and 94.2%, respectively, for MyDiagnostick;

54.5% and 97.5%, respectively, for AliveCor) (Geriatrics:

89.5% and 95.7%, respectively, for MyDiagnostick; 78.9%

and 97.9%, respectively, for AliveCor).
Manual interpretation increases sensitivity, but decreases

specificity, doubling the cost per detected patient, but

remains cheaper than sole 12-lead EKG screening.

The accuracy of blinded clinician interpretation of

single-lead smartphone electrocardiograms was investigated

by conducting a prospective, blinded, observational cohort

study in which Consecutive patients 18 years and older

undergoing electrical cardioversions for AF and atrial flutter

were recruited over 12 months (19). AHM was paired with

an iPhone 6-Plus smartphone using the Kardia application.

Three consecutive 30-second lead I recordings (iEKG) were

obtained with finger placement on the 2 electrodes at the

back of the iPhone. Following each AHM recording, the

automated rhythm analysis recorded the rhythm as either

possible AF, normal sinus rhythm, or unclassified. A 12-lead

EKG was obtained prior to the iEKG tracings, both pre-

and post- cardioversion. On assessing the accuracy of AHM

on all tracings, including “unclassified” readings (marked

as incorrect), the AHM demonstrated reduced sensitivity

(77%) and specificity (76%).

These devices receive most interest for opportunistic

screening, as they are easy to use, portable, low-cost, allow

fast rhythm strip recordings, do not require experienced

personnel, and often have built-in algorithms that provide

an immediate interpretation of the EKG. There are also

limitations for their use. The majority of false positives

results originated from pulse waveforms that were corrupted

by finger movement artifacts that may have affected the

detection algorithm. This issue may lead to a reduction in

specificity when the smartphone application is used outside

the clinic because of potentially more motion artifacts in an

unsupervised setting, e.g., using it repeatedly at home over

a period of weeks or even longer. A high number of false

positives could create additional work for clinicians to rule

out AF. Another drawback of the application is the inability

to detect atrial flutter that may also confer some risk of

stroke and frequently accompanies AF.
Conclusions
The fact that there is a significant increase in consumer

use of wearables, smart watches; which can serve as health

monitoring devices that can be used as a non-invasive,

ambulatory assessment of heart rate and rhythm, is

definitely novel. The different wearable technology and

its efficacy in detecting AF (Table 1) is well demonstrated

in different studies. The demonstration of majority of the

study population in the apple study seeking medical help

after being notified is encouraging. On the flip side, false

positives can cause undue anxiety to the user and may drive

up health costs with unwarranted ER visits. The system of

irregular rhythm notification in people without a known

diagnosis of AF supported by physician review can help in

uncovering the subclinical AF population.

Recent evidence shows that intermittent short EKG

recordings repeated over a longer-term period produced

significantly better sensitivity for AF detection, with

4 times as many cases diagnosed compared with a single

time-point measurement (20). This further reiterates the

fact that these wearables serve as an excellent resource for

continuous EKG monitoring with data saved in the cloud

which can be assessed from anywhere, as compared to other

devices as Holter monitors and event monitors, limited by

the intermittent nature of monitoring and the need to be

returned for analysis. In addition, they also are non-invasive

methods for prolonged periods of screening compared to

the invasive implantable loop recorders. Data also shows

that preference of patients lean more towards wearable

technology as they are perceived as convenient by 98%,

while 90% conveyed they were likely to use these devices to

determine cardiac rhythm during symptomatic episodes as

opposed to conventional Holter monitoring system (21).
The technology may however be limited by patient

specific barriers, like age. The prevalence of AF markedly

increases with age, though older population may be more

resistant in adopting these wearable technologies. The

cohort in the Apple heart study were overwhelmingly

young and healthier. Furthermore, studies are required to

adjudicate the effectiveness of the wearables in detecting

AF in high risk population. Plus, compared the smart

watch technology, where there is an element of passive

detection, the smart phone apps and handheld EKG

have an active aspect of user participation for recording

strips of EKG. Improper use may not yield proper data.

Even the smartwatches have to overcome improper data

measurements triggered by motion and hand movement,

which may yield false positives. The technological

shortcomings are bound to get better with more research

and development poured into these devices and the

detection algorithms. Future iterations of these devices will

improve its efficiency to better detect the subclinical AF.

These devices have even shown to be cost-effective when

used in a community screening program (22,23) and they can

be used for the follow-up assessment of the effectiveness of

AF treatment. Thus, the wearable technology may not serve

as the ultimate tool for diagnosis of AF, rather a nidus for the

general population to seek medical advice on being notified

of having an irregular rhythm for confirmation leading to

prevention of morbidity and mortality associated with it.
