## Fitbit trackers aren't the force they used to be, but there's still one device that keeps the legacy alive
Google has fundamentally transformed the Fitbit brand since its 2021 takeover, making it increasingly hard to choose between the lineup of smartwatches and fitness trackers. But not necessarily in a good way.
Branded Fitbit products and the classic tracker lines are undoubtedly worse off since the absorption into the Google machine. As such, the best ‘Fitbit’ you can buy is actually the Google Pixel Watch 4 (or the Pixel Watch 3, if you’re on a tighter budget).
The current-generation watch series represents the most in-depth and accurate Fitbit experience in 2025. However, those seeking a traditional Fitbit fitness tracker still have options, and we’ll detail each of them in this buyer’s guide.
We’ve reviewed and compared every Fitbit available on the market. Below, you’ll find summaries of each model, specifications comparisons, and insights into what Google may be planning next for Fitbit.

## What to expect from Google and Fitbit in 2026
![google-pixel-watch-4-sleep](https://www.wareable.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)(Image credit: Wareable)
It’s been a quiet few years for the Fitbit brand, defined by [Google’s August 2025 announcement that Fitbit smartwatches would no longer be produced](https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/google-kills-fitbit-smartwatches-rip-sense-3-versa-5). 
That means Google’s smartwatch focus is almost exclusively on its Pixel Watch line, save for the Fitbit Ace LTE (currently US-only, and the only product released under the brand in 2024).
After spending a few years nerfing the Fitbit Versa 4 and Sense 2 smartwatches, this was no surprise—[we called it well before it actually happened](https://wareable.substack.com/p/fitbit-as-we-know-it-is-dead). As expected, then, there have been no significant hardware launches under the Fitbit banner in 2025.
However, in October 2025, signs of life began to appear. Upon officially announcing that [Fitbit Coach would headline a completely revamped app experience](https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-ai-coach-app-update-preview-announcement-avilability), Google also quietly confirmed that [new Fitbit devices will arrive in 2026](https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/new-fitbit-wearables-trackers-2026-release-date-confirmed).
There’s no concrete information (or leaks) to point to what kind of Fitbit wearables we can expect, but our best guess is that a refresh of its fitness trackers is in the works. That could mean a long-awaited Fitbit Charge 7 and Inspire 4 finally hit store shelves. 
We’ll update this section with more information as and when it becomes clearer.
* * *
## Google Pixel Watch 4
![google-pixel-watch-4-watch-face-moss](https://www.wareable.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)(Image credit: Wareable)
* * *
#### The best Fitbit smartwatch 
The Pixel Watch 4 is a Fitbit in its own right, with the core tracking experience powered by Google’s algorithms and design.
The key difference between the fourth-gen Pixel Watch and a Fitbit smartwatch like the Sense 2 (below) is that the Pixel Watch runs [Wear OS 6](https://www.wareable.com/android-wear/google-wear-os-6-new-features-which-watches-rollout), rather than Fitbit OS. That means it offers the full selection of apps from Google’s suite (including Maps, Gmail, Calendar, and Home) and [third-party offerings from the Google Play Store](https://www.wareable.com/android-wear/you-wear-it-well-the-best-apps-for-android-wear).
The Pixel Watch 4, like its predecessor, is available in a 41mm and a larger, 45mm circular case. It also boasts a much-improved domed screen, and we consider it close to the [Apple Watch Series 11](https://www.wareable.com/apple/apple-watch-series-11-review) in terms of versatility. It’s a great-looking watch, made slightly better by its brighter display (now with a peak brightness of 3,000 nits) and more edge-to-edge display than its predecessors.
  * **[Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3](https://www.wareable.com/smartwatches/google-pixel-watch-4-vs-3-comparison-key-differences)**


The ace up its sleeve is that Fitbit underpins the entire tracking experience. The Fitbit app is where you’ll view everything, including 24/7 heart rate data, Health Metrics Dashboard information, sleep tracking with sleep stages data, the Daily Readiness Score, and the all-new Cardio Load/Target Load.
#### What are the downsides of this pick?
Battery life remains the big trade-off for this extra power and features—at least when you compare the Pixel Watch devices to other Fitbit models.
The 41mm version lasts only 24-30 hours with the always-on display enabled, according to our real-world testing. And though the 45mm version bumps that to a much more manageable two-day (or more, depending on how conservative your usage is) battery life, it’s still only a fraction of what something like the Fitbit Versa 4 offers.
With the significantly larger price tag, too, it’s not an automatic recommendation. But this is comfortably—and we can’t emphasize this enough—the best way to experience the Fitbit platform in 2025 and into next year, with our testing finding the tracking to be largely very accurate.
Plus, the [Pixel Watch 3](https://www.wareable.com/reviews/google-pixel-watch-3-review) is now often available at a cut-rate price if you are looking for the next best option.

## Fitbit Charge 6
![Fitbit Charge 6](https://www.wareable.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)(Image credit: Wareable)
* * *
#### The most advanced Fitbit tracker
Released in 2023, the Charge 6 is still Fitbit’s flagship wristband. Yet, it’s not that different from the previous generation released in 2021.
The stainless steel case and AMOLED display are still present, as is the sensor array that provides insights into skin temperature, daily stress (EDA sensor), heart rhythms (ECG), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), and location tracking (GPS). 
While it may look and act almost identically to the Charge 5, there are a couple of significant additions to be aware of. One is the return of the side button, last seen in the Charge 4. This makes interacting with the device a much more pleasant experience. 
  * **[Fitbit Charge 6 vs. Fitbit Charge 5](https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-charge-6-vs-charge-5)**


We’ve now had time to review and re-review this device. While we still recommend it, it’s important to understand the Charge 6’s blind spots – and the fact they haven’t been fixed (because they appear to be inherent to the design).
It can work if you want the chunkier, more male-friendly form factor (or features like ECG). The Charge 6 brings Fitbit’s platform to your wrist in a sleek and easy-to-wear package made even better with the reintroduction of the side button.
Yet, we found significant problems with the heart rate and GPS accuracy, undermining a huge part of its USP. As we say, this is related to the design and has been well documented by frustrated Charge 6 users in forums over the last couple of years. It results in one or the other working during outdoor exercise, which is a huge oversight and issue. Beware if this area is essential to you.

## Fitbit Inspire 3
![Fitbit Inspire 3](https://www.wareable.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)(Image credit: Wareable)
* * *
#### The best Fitbit fitness tracker
We love the Inspire 3. It represents a massive update from the Inspire 2 and is still a superb value fitness tracker despite being overdue for an update.
The color screen elevates the whole experience while not destroying the battery life, with 10 days on offer between charges. We got over a week in our testing with heavy use.
SpO2 also debuts on the Inspire 3 for the first time, which is now ubiquitous across the whole range. Fitbit packs a temperature sensor, too, offering the full range of Health Metrics dashboard features. 
Add in the new continuous scanning for heart rhythm problems and Active Zone Minutes, top sleep tracking (including the new sleep profiles), and not-too-shabby workout tracking – the Inspire 3 is extraordinarily complete as a fitness tracking device. 
And you can get some excellent deals on it, too.
  * **Check out our full[Fitbit Inspire 3 review](https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-inspire-3-review-8978)**

## Fitbit Versa 4
![Fitbit Versa 4](https://www.wareable.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)
* * *
#### A solid entry-level smartwatch
The Versa 4 is the last version of Fitbit’s smartwatch set to be released, but it’s still an option while Google keeps software up to date. With an excellent six-day battery life and a mid-range price tag, it’s a solid alternative to the Pixel Watch 3/4.
The key to understanding the Versa 4 is that it unlocks the main Fitbit experience in a smartwatch form factor. You get brilliant sleep tracking, heart rate data, and the Health Metrics dashboard. It’s also a decent workout partner.
There’s no ECG here, but the Versa 4 will still scan for irregular heart rate events using the PPG sensor. Fitbit also added a tactile button to a lighter case for this generation, making the watch easier to use.
However, the Versa 4 is not a groundbreaking experience. While it does basic notifications and supports Google Wallet and Google Maps, things like watch faces feel clunky. What’s more, there are zero apps or third-party experiences.
In short, it’s a great Fitbit and an average smartwatch, and thus comes recommended to those who value Fitbit’s strengths over techy features. Just be sure to keep that potentially limited software support if you do plump for it.

## Fitbit Sense 2
![FItbit Sense 2](https://www.wareable.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)(Image credit: Wareable)
#### A nice-looking Fitbit with neat health features
Fitbit’s more dedicated health watch, the Sense 2, goes all-in on stress tracking. The EDA sensor reads stress responses via the palm and is now continuous. It’s called the Body Response Sensor and can offer a much more detailed look at stressful feelings, prompting you for manual feedback on how you feel. 
If you’re concerned about stress, it can provide an interesting touchpoint in taking control of your feelings. However, we found it wasn’t actionable enough, and didn’t connect the dots between stress and our behaviors and habits, such as stress, nutrition, and sleep.
This generation is also lighter and thinner than its predecessor, while still managing to pack in the ECG sensor found on the original Sense. 
When we performed our original test, we found it an excellent health watch, even though problems persist as a smartwatch. Most Fitbits now scan for heart rhythm issues using the HR sensor, and even the Inspire 3 now packs SpO2 and temperature sensing.
It means the Sense 2 feels hard to justify at this price point, especially when the Google Pixel Watch 3/4 does the same things—with Google apps, services, and a rich, modern-feeling device. There’s also the Versa 4, which offers broadly the same features (without ECG/EDA) for less cash.
Also, remember Google won’t be producing a Sense 3 smartwatch. This could result in increasingly limited and deprioritized software support for this watch.

## Fitbit Luxe
![Fitbit Luxe](https://www.wareable.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)(Image credit: Wareable)
#### Best Fitbit for style 
The Fitbit Luxe offers a more luxurious stainless steel case and a color AMOLED display, both of which are a huge visual step up from the Inspire range.
It’s something you might want to wear, and, while the look and feel are Luxe, the price tag is reassuringly affordable.
It comes in white, black, or pink, and there’s also a special edition with a gold link bracelet. It’s not exclusively for women, but quite obviously marketed that way.
In terms of features, there’s nothing exclusive to Luxe, but plenty of top features filter down the Fitbit range. It’s not as advanced as the Charge 6 (with no GPS, for example) but trumps the Inspire range with its SpO2 sensor for blood oxygen.
There’s also a new drive towards mindfulness, and it will track stress using a daily score. That’s on top of sleep, heart rate, and steps – everything you expect from Fitbit.
In short, the Luxe puts the best parts of the Fitbit experience in a nicer, sleeker, and more stylish package. What’s not to like about that?

## Fitbit Ace LTE
![Fitbit Ace LTE](https://www.wareable.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)
* * *
#### The best Fitbit smartwatch for kids
We’ve not fully tested this smartwatch, as it’s still only available in the US after launching in summer 2024. But the Fitbit Ace LTE is a kid-friendly smartwatch for children aged 7 and up.
It features six games and encourages kids to move for at least 60 minutes daily to unlock more playtime. 
The watch includes safety features, such as device location and voice calls, available through a $9.99/month subscription. Parents can monitor their child’s activity via the Fitbit Ace app. 
But it’s pricey. At $229.95, you need to pay an extra $9.99 monthly for the location services. But it’s getting rave reviews online and is, at last, a proper feature-rich kids watch from a true wearable brand.
* * *
## Fitbit Ace 3
![Ace 2](https://www.wareable.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)Credit: Google Fitbit
* * *
#### The best Fitbit tracker for kids
The Fitbit Ace 3 is aimed at kids aged six and up, with the latest generation featuring a modular design that utilizes a bumper to keep the display a little more protected as kids run around and play.
The Ace 3 puts move reminders at its core, reminding kids to get those 250 steps per minute on their way to 60 minutes of active time each day.
It’s still a monochrome display, so there are no colors here. And the main features are still step tracking, sports monitoring, and sleep insights. There’s no heart rate monitor, but it does boast swim-proof 5ATM water resistance.
Bedtime reminders and silent alarms help parents instill a settled sleep schedule, with timers and ”race the stopwatch’ features also built into the watch.
The larger tracker also means a battery life boost. It will now last eight days between charging, up from six days in the previous generation.
