##  Frequently Asked Questions 
###  What is Salesforce? 
Salesforce is the [**#1 AI CRM**](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/worlds-number-one-crm/) (customer relationship management) platform. We bring companies and customers together by providing a unified set of applications — powered by [agentic AI](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-is-agentic-ai/)[ ](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-is-agentic-ai/)and data — that help every department, including sales, service, marketing, commerce, and IT, work as one. You can learn more about [what Salesforce is](https://www.salesforce.com/products/what-is-salesforce/) and [what Salesforce does](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-does-salesforce-do/) by visiting [our official resources](https://www.salesforce.com/company/our-story/). Our cloud-based agentic solutions help you find more leads, close more deals, and provide better service to your customers, all on a single, integrated agentic platform.
###  What is CRM and why do I need one? 
[**CRM**](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/what-is-crm/) stands for **customer relationship management.** It’s a technology for managing all your company’s relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. A CRM system helps you:  
  
**• Organize** contact information, leads, and customer service data  
**• Automate** tasks like logging calls and sending follow-up emails**  
• Analyze** data to understand customer behavior and business performance  
  
A CRM, especially one powered by AI like Salesforce, is essential for growth because it gives you a**single** , [**360-degree view** of every customer](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-exactly-is-salesforce-customer-360/), allowing you to build stronger, more profitable relationships at scale.
###  What is agentic AI and how is it used in Salesforce? 
[**Agentic AI**](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-is-agentic-ai/) refers to advanced artificial intelligence systems that can act [**autonomously**](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/ai-agents/autonomous-agents/) to achieve a specific goal with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional [AI](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-ai/)[ ](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-ai/)that only generates content or analyzes data, agentic AI can reason, plan multistep actions, and execute tasks.  
  
In Salesforce, agentic AI — part of our [**Agentforce**](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/) technology — is used to:  
  
**• Automate** complex workflows like lead qualification or service case resolution  
**• Predict** business outcomes, such as which deals are likely to close  
**• Personalize** every customer interaction across marketing, sales, and service channels
###  How does Salesforce CRM help my small business grow? 
Salesforce offers agentic CRM solutions tailored for companies of all sizes, from [startups and small businesses](https://www.salesforce.com/small-business/)[ ](https://www.salesforce.com/small-business/)to large global enterprises. Our Agentforce 360 Platform is **flexible** and **scalable** , allowing you to start with the essentials you need — like sales, service, commerce, or marketing — and easily add more functionality as your business grows. This ensures you only pay for what you use and have an [AI and CRM](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/ai-crm/) platform that can grow with your business.
